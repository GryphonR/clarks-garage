I have had them replace the radiator on my 944 as well as diagnose a
clunking noise from the rear (turned out to be shocks.)  I actually had a
glitch with the rad job, car heated up on the way home and they treated me
right, paid for the tow back to the shop as well as replaced the defective
fan switch.  Not cheap but friendly and the owner drives a new 911-body
Turbo.  They seem to specialize in Porsches, mostly 911s and 944s although I
have seen a few BMWs in the parking lot.  At least one of their mechanics
drives a 944 and a BMW 535i.
