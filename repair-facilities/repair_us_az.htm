			Stuttgart SW is owned by Jack Doverspike and has been
servicing all models of Porsches for many years.  The quality of service
is high and the costs are reasonable. Jack is always helpful and knows
both the 911s and watercooled cars quite well.  Many Porsche Club of
America members use this shop.
