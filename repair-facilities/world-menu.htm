<B>Welcome. This is a directory of Porsche Repair Facilities. The shops located on this site may or may not be factory authorized repair facilities. Factory authorized facilities are generally only found at Porsche dealers. However, that does not make the facilities listed here any less capable of repairing and maintaining your car to the same high level of performance.<P>
Use the directory below to navigate to a repair facility in your area. If you do not find an active link for your country or state, it's because no one has provided information on repair facilities in your area. As soon as I have information for even one facility in your area, I will add it to the site and the link for your area will be activated.<P>
If you would like to provide information for repair facilities in your area please do so by sending an <A href="mailto:fletch944t@hotmail.com"><I>email to me</I></A>. Please include the following information in your email:<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Name of Repair Facility
	<LI>Address
	<LI>Phone number
	<LI>E-mail and web site address (if they have them)
	<LI>Hourly Repair Rate (if known)
	<LI>Comment (Quality of service, promptness of service, etc.)
