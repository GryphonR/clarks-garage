			Services performed include mechanical/electrical work on all German cars. 15 years of experience with all the German makes, but with more emphasis on Porsches. Can handle engine and suspension repair and setup on street or race cars, registered PCA tech inspection station. Owner has been driving, racing, and instructing in 924/944/951 cars for a long time and has a lot to offer to someone looking for help with one of these cars. Doesn't have an alignment rack yet, but has access to a brand new machine and corner balancing scales at a race shop 2 miles away. 3 944s and 2 928s have been sent there already with great results. All parts are OE and reasonably priced (thank you SSF) and will sell parts over the counter as well as mail order. Parts requests can be e mailed anytime or phoned in during business hours.	<P>

			Reason for selection. The price is right and the work is meticulous. Both
Sonny and Peter are Porsche club members and  participate in all Porsche
events. True enthusiasts. All tranny and engine work done on premises. No
bull, just good work.

			They do everything from oil changes on a minivan to rebuilding a 911 engine that jumped timing.  Mory (the owner) is a serious perfectionist, and they only use OE parts and Spies-Hecker paints (the OE paint supplier to Porsche).  Jeff (Mory's son and one of the mechanics) used to own my 84 944, and it was in practically factory fresh condition when I bought it.<BR>

The service isn't always super fast, as they tend to have a lot of business but the quality is well worth it, especially for big jobs.  They won't take shortcuts, and if it means waiting for a special order part from Germany, you'll just have to wait.  They are scrupulously honest which is hard to find in mechanics, and will tell you straight what the deal is. I've known and used them for almost 20 years, and will not go to anyone else for jobs I can't do myself.  <BR>

They store cars in a dry environment upstairs, which is very convenient for the Buffalo winters.<P>
