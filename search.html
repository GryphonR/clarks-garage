It may be worth your time and effort to concentrate your search for a car in an area where the supply is much larger. Not only will you find a better selection, but the prices can be significantly less. In my case, I saved myself several thousand dollars by buying a car in Atlanta, GA instead of Charlotte, NC. This strategy does of course have its drawbacks. It can require a lot of research in the classified ads of newspapers and possibly a number of long distance phone calls. However, searching Internet classified ads can now make this process much more cost effective and less time consuming. The best and most frequently offered advice on purchasing a 944 is to purchase the best example you can afford. While a car that needs a little fixing up may seem like a great deal on the surface, over the long haul it will probably end up costing you more money. Unless, of course you do all your own work. A good set of maintenance records is almost a must when purchasing a 944. Some of the maintenance items on a 944 carry a big price tag. For example, if you're trying to decide between two cars, the one that recently had the clutch replaced may be the better choice, even if it costs several hundred dollars more. The 944 timing belts are a key maintenance item that should have been done at the required intervals. If maintenance records can not demonstrate that they have been replaced or inspected at required intervals, either pass on the car, have them replaced prior to purchase, or ask for a lower price and replace them immediately after purchase. Neglected timing belt maintenance will cost you a lot of money. Have any car you are seriously thinking about purchasing inspected by a mechanic familiar with 944s. A good 944 mechanic can tell you what needs to be fixed immediately, what can wait, and what your average maintenance costs might be. To perform an adequate inspection, the car should be put on a lift and the belly pan removed. Here's a list of specific items that should be looked at: The area between the back timing cover and the block should be inspected for oil and/or coolant. The presence of oil can indicate a leaking front crankshaft seal or leaking balance shaft seal. The presence of water normally indicates a leaking water pump although it can also indicate a leaking head gasket. Inspect the area around the oil filter housing. You may find some oil in this area. It is extremely difficult to change the oil filter without spilling some oil. However, the oil pressure sensor and filter housing itself can also be a source of oil leakage. Inspect the power steering pump, hoses, and power steering rack for leakage. The hose from the fluid reservoir to the pump is a common source of leakage. Sometimes tightening the clamp will stop the leakage. Do not tighten excessively as the reservoir is plastic and you can crack the nozzle. A leaking hose may not seem like a big deal, but one hose on a 944 can cost you $150-200 (not including labor). Inspect the exhaust manifolds for cracks or signs of leakage (i.e. soot from the exhaust on engine or suspension parts). The exhaust manifolds are expensive to replace even if you can find them in a salvage yard. Inspect the balance shaft housing covers for leakage. Repairing leaks here are not that difficult, but require a lot of time and can consequently cost a lot of money. While the price of 944 motor mounts has come down in recent years, they are still around $150-200 a pair. You'll normally get charged around four hours labor for replacement. The 944 FAQ details a good method for checking the motor mounts. A number of heat shield are used to protect various components underneath the car. It's a good idea to have someone check the car that is familiar enough with 944s to identify if any heat shields are missing. One of the most important components protected by a heat shield is the starter. It can fail in a short period of time if its heat shield is missing. Check for a leaking oil pan gasket. Inspect the tie rod ends and ball joints for cracked or missing protective boots. The ball joints are not replaceable on later model 944s. The control arms must be replaced ($$) or rebuilt. Check the master cylinder and slave cylinder for leakage. If the car is equipped with an external oil cooler (to the right of the radiator), inspect the cooler and oil lines for leaks. Check all coolant lines for leakage. On Normally Aspirated and Turbocharged cars equipped with the turbo water pump, the plastic nozzle on the front of the pump (blank nozzle) has an o-ring which is a common source of coolant leakage. Check the coolant in the reservoir. A brown frothy mixture in the reservoir usually indicates oil and water mixing in the oil filter/cooler housing. Many people are under the mistaken impression that this can not happen with the turbocharged cars since they have an external oil cooler. While it is not as common, it can an does occur. Inspect for oil leakage at the back of the camshaft housing near the firewall. The rear cam housing cover plate uses a cork gasket which is a common source of leakage. Inspect the area around the distributor housing. There are several oil seals in the housing that can be a source of leakage. Inspect the fuel lines going to the fuel rail for brittleness or cracking. These have been the subject of several recalls and the source of a number of engine fires. Inspect the plug wires for brittleness or cracking. Check the transaxle half shafts for excessive play. There will be some play along the axis of the shaft, but there should be little or no play perpendicular to the axis of the shaft. Top of Page Driving and engine running inspection: The car should have a steady idle between 900 and 1000 rpm. A high, low, or hunting idle can indicate (but is not limited to) a sticking idle stabilizer valve. With the engine cold, the oil pressure should read between 4 and 5 bar at idle. As the engine temperature increases, the oil pressure will gradually decrease to around 2 bar. It may go slightly less than 2 bar on a very hot day or when the car is driven very hard. However, it should never decrease to less than 1 bar. A low oil pressure at all temperatures can be indicative of a sticking oil pressure relief valve and can result in oil starvation and bearing damage. If a low oil pressure is indicated, the engine should not be run until the cause has been determined and corrected. A high oil pressure which never decreases to less than 4 bar is normally caused by a faulty oil pressure sending unit. Engine coolant temperature should normally read between the second and third white marks. Temperatures consistently at or above the second white mark should be investigated and corrected. A clicking noise under the hood with the car running is normal. This is the injectors firing. However, valve train noise is sometimes masked by the injectors firing. Use a mechanics stethoscope if you have any doubts about the difference between injector and valve noise. Engine vibration at idle can indicate bad motor mounts or incorrectly installed balance shaft belt. Vibration from bad motor mounts will usually disappear when the engine speed is increase to around 1500 rpm. With the engine running, it's a good time to listen for leaks at the exhaust manifolds. A piece of garden hose or other hose can be used like a stethoscope to pinpoint suspected leaks. Vibrations experienced while driving on the road can be indicative of a number of problems. Some of them include alignment problems, tie rod ends, ball joints, sway bar bushings, and tire imbalance or abnormal wear. At maximum boost, an unmodified, turbocharged car should produce approximately 1.7 - 1.75 bar of boost. Clicking in the rear end while driving, especially during cornering, normally indicates a problem with the CV joints. It can also indicate a problem with the wheel bearings or transaxle itself. CV joint noise can sometimes be corrected by repacking the CV joint/boot.

The 924, 944, and 928 Models 1977 - 1988 Parts and Technical Reference Catalog is a valuable tool for ordering parts. The part number for the catalog is PNA 000 147 A. The 944 Factory Shop Manuals are very useful and very expensive. However, the price continues to come down. The six volume set is now available for around $225 US. If you have a turbo model, you'll also need the turbo supplement which costs around $50 US. While the shop manuals are very nice to have, there are many jobs which can still be done without them. The shop manuals are available in the United States because of the &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot; passed by the U.S. Congress. However, the manuals are still unavailable in most countries outside the United States. Haynes makes a manual for the 944 which is available at most major auto parts stores for under $15 US. The Haynes manual does not provide procedures for many jobs which they feel are beyond the capability of the home mechanic. However, the procedures they do provide have good detail and good pictures. The Haynes manual is written based on an early model (pre-85.5), so you will discover differences if you're working on a later model or turbocharged car.

Around 176 cars were released for the European market in 1985 with the first cars for the US being released in the 1986 model year. Even before the first 944 Turbo debuted at Geneva, a pre-production 944 Turbo competed at and won the 24-Hour endurance race at Nelson Ledges in June 1984. 2.0  Differences Between the 944 and 944 Turbo 2.1  Foreword      In Section 2, we will compare the differences between the 944 and the 944 Turbo. Bear in mind that these comparisons only apply to the 1985 and 1986 944 Turbos as compared to 944s built up to that time. Later models of the normally aspirated cars were equipped with much of the same equipment as their turbocharged counterparts. In a later section, we'll look at how the 944 Turbos changed with each model year. 2.2  Engine      The 944 Turbo engine retained the same 2.5L displacement of the normally aspirated 944s. However, the addition of a KKK K-26 #6 turbocharger, along with other supporting modifications, yielded some very impressive performance numbers. Performance Comparisons 1985 911 Carrera 1985 928S 1985 944 1985 944 Turbo Displacement 3164 cc 4957 cc 2479 cc 2479 cc Horsepower (SAE) 200 288 143 217 Torque (SAE ft-lb) 185 @ 4800 302 @ 2700 137 @ 3000 243 @ 3500 0- 60 mph 6.3 6.1 8.3 6.1 Top Speed (mph) 146 155 130 152 Fuel Consumption       City 17 17 23 21*     Highway 25 28 36 33* * Estimated numbers at the time of release. Note: The numbers in this table were originally published in the March 1985 issue of Panorama. However, the 0-60 mph number for the 944 Turbo was actually a 0-100 kph number of 6.3 seconds. Since the 0-60 mph time was available from another source, it is included for a better point of reference.      Unlike the 924 Turbo, the turbocharger on the 944 Turbo was moved to the opposite side of the engine from the exhaust. This helped reduce the turbocharger inlet temperatures by approximately 160 °F. Additionally, the turbocharger has a water-cooled bearing housing. During normal operation, the cooling water is supplied from the engine cooling system via a tap on the low temperature side of the radiator. The cooling water returns to the water pump suction via a small thermostat or to the expansion tank if the thermostat is closed. During shutdown, coolant is supplied from the radiator and expansion tank and circulated through the bearing housing and back to the expansion tank. The water in the expansion tank is cooled by being siphoned through the makeup line to the radiator. Coolant circulation through the turbocharger bearing housing is supported by an electric pump. The combination of lower inlet temperatures and water-cooling to the bearing housing dramatically increased the turbocharger life expectancy over the 924 Turbo and 911 Turbo.      The 951 cylinder head received several modifications as well. The cylinder head exhaust ports have ceramic liners cast into them. This results in higher exhaust temperatures and better turbo response. This is somewhat of a contradiction to moving the turbocharger away from the exhaust side of the engine. However, what it does is provide insulation that allows the energy to be retained in the exhaust gases and converted into work in the turbine rather that being lost as rejected heat into the cylinder head. An additional benefit of this is a reduction in the heat load on the cooling system. The 944 Turbos also use sodium filled valves in the cylinder head for better heat dissipation.      An intercooler is used with the 944 Turbo system to cool the charge air before it enters the engine. The 944 Turbo intercooler reduces the charge air temperature by approximately 135 °F to provide a denser charge of air and a noticeable increase in horsepower. Because of the increase in engine performance, the engine also received thicker cylinder walls, forged pistons, a larger oil pump, and heavier head gasket. 944 Turbos were also equipped with an external oil cooler as opposed to the normally aspirated cars whose cooler is integral to the block. 2.3  Transaxle      The 944 Turbo received a transaxle with a different gear ratio from the normally aspirated cars. The 944 Turbo transaxle employed an external oil cooler which was not used on the normally aspirated cars. Also, a transaxle with limited slip differential and external oil cooler was available as optional equipment. Below is a table which compares the 951 gear ratios to the 944s. The different transaxles used in 944 Turbos will be discussed in a later section.   1986 944 (ROW) 016J 1986 944 (US/Japan) 016K 1986 944 Turbo 016R 1st Gear 3.6000 3.6000 3.5000 2nd Gear 2.1250 2.1250 2.0588 3rd Gear 1.4583 1.4583 1.4000 4th Gear 1.0714 1.0714 1.0345 5th Gear 0.8286 0.7297 0.8286 Reverse Gear 3.5000 3.5000 3.5000 Final Drive Ratio 3.8890 3.8890 3.3750 2.4  Body      The 944 Turbo introduced some body changes that carried over to later water-cooled models. Most noticeable is the aerodynamic front end. The new front end integrated both the fog lights and the front bumper into a single panel. The front panel has several ducts that provide cooling air flow to the engine. The 944 Turbo has a larger frontal silhouette than the normally aspirated 944 (1.89 m2 vs. 1.82 m2). However, the smooth lines of the new front end resulted in a lower drag coefficient for the turbo (0.33 vs. 0.35). In addition to the spoiler mounted to the rear hatch, the 944 Turbo also carries a spoiler mounted underneath the rear bumper. Air flow between the bottom of the car and the spoiler provides negative lift which improves the car's stability, particularly at high speeds. The 951s also have side skirts mounted at the bottom of the rocker panels. 2.5  Suspension, Brakes, and Wheels      The 944 Turbo front brakes have a smaller surface area than the normally aspirated cars (86 cm2 vs. 92 cm2 per wheel). However, the turbo uses the same brake pad in the rear while the normally aspirated cars use a smaller pad (63 cm2 per wheel). This results in a total brake area of 344 cm2 for the turbo and 310 cm2 for the 944. Additionally, the 944 Turbo uses 4-piston fixed caliper brakes while the 944 uses single-piston floating caliper brakes. Both models use vented rotors.      The 951s came equipped with 16&quot; cast aluminum wheels (7J x 16 front, 8J x 16 rear). The tires were 205/55 VR 16s front and 225/50 VR 16s rear. Forged aluminum wheels were available as a factory option. Standard equipment on the normally aspirated cars was 7J x 15 wheels with 205/60 VR 15 tires. As optional equipment the 944s could be equipped with the 7J x 16 forged alloy wheels used on the 911s with 205/55 VR 16 tires.      The 944s came equipped with 20 mm front stabilizer bars as standard equipment. Rear stabilizers were only available as an option (14mm). They were also available with 21.5 mm solid or 23 x 3.5 mm tubular front stabilizers. On the 944s rear torsion bars were 23.5mm. The 951s came equipped with 22.5 mm stabilizer bars in front and 18mm stabilizers in the rear and 23.5 mm torsion bars. Tubular front stabilizers were also available for the turbos (24 x 3.7 mm). Until 1985.5, 944s came equipped with steel control arms. Later models were equipped with light alloy control arms. 951s were equipped with the light alloy control arms. Due to the wide variations in shocks, struts, and springs used on the 944s and 944 Turbos, we won't try to discuss them all now to avoid confusion. However, in a later section we will discuss the differences between 944 Turbo model years. 2.6  Interior      There is essentially no difference in the interior of the 944 and 944 Turbo. The only noticeable difference is the addition of a Boost gauge underneath the tachometer. 3.0  Model Year Differences 3.1  Foreword      Now that we've compared the first 944 Turbos to their normally aspirated counterparts, we'll try to take a look at how the turbos changed with each model year. I'll try to cover as many of the changes as possible. If I miss some of the changes or corrections need to be made, please let me know. 3.2  1987 Model Year      There were minor modifications to the 951 engine for the 1987 model year. Most notable is the change from the eccentric roller cam belt tensioner to a spring tensioner arrangement. This change also occurred on the normally aspirated cars. Also, an oil level sending unit was added to the oil pan which illuminates a low oil level light on the dash. The 1987 model cars were provided with a one piece oil pressure relief valve as opposed to three piece unit on the 1986 models. As a result of the addition of the cam belt spring tensioner and changes to the water pump pulley arrangement, a new set of timing covers were produced for the 1987 models.      Beginning in the 1987 model year, the 944 Turbo transaxle came without and external oil cooler as standard equipment. However, the transaxle with cooler as well as the transaxle with limited slip differential and cooler were still available as optional equipment.      In 1987, ABS was offered as optional equipment on both normally aspirated cars as well as turbos. This required the wheel offset to be increased for the 1987 model year from 23.3 mm to 52.3 mm. All cars received the increased offset wheels even if they were not equipped with ABS. Tubular front stabilizers were used on the 1987 model cars (25.5mm x 4 mm).      The M030 suspension option was made available starting in the 1987 model year. With this option the front tubular stabilizer size increased to 26.5 mm x 4mm. Through the end of the 1988 model year, FS black struts were standard equipment on 944 Turbos with Koni yellow struts as optional equipment. With the M030 option, height adjustable Koni yellow struts were added. Also with the M030 option, the strut bearings have a harder rubber compound than earlier models which can be identified by a green stripe on the underside of the bearing. The spring rate for all 944 Turbos not equipped with the M030 option is 21.8 N/mm with an unsprung length of 251 mm (through the end of the '88 MY). The M030 option springs have a rate of 28 N/mm with an unsprung length of 220 mm.      For the rear suspension, all 944 Turbos through the end of the 1988 model year were equipped with FS grey shock absorbers as standard equipment. Koni yellows were available as optional equipment. With the M030 option, the Koni yellow shock absorbers will have two white dots offset by 180°. Also with the M030 option, the torsion bar size was increased to 25.5 mm.      On the interior, the 1987 944 Turbo became the first production car in the world to be equipped with driver and passenger side air bags as standard equipment. On the normally aspirated 944s for that year, the driver's side air bag was standard equipment, but the passenger side air bag was optional. As already mentioned, a low oil level light was added to the dash. Also, a 180 mph speedometer was added as opposed to the 170 mph speedometer on the 1986 model Turbos. 3.3  1988 Model Year      There were no significant changes to the 944 Turbo until the middle of the 1988 model year. One minor change involved changing the chip arrangement in the DME unit. Earlier 944 Turbos (86/87) have a DME with a 24-pin chip. Beginning with the 1988 model year, a DME with a 28-pin chip was installed. It's not exactly clear why this change was made, but it has been rumored that it was in anticipation that more control features were going to be added to later models. At any rate, the 1988 DMEs received the same map as the early cars and I've been told that the extra 4 pins on later DMEs were never used.      In 1988½ Porsche introduced a new 944 Turbo which was designated as a 944 Turbo S. The first example of the 944 Turbo S were a limited production run. Exact numbers on the limited production 951 S cars varies, but seem to be between 750 and 1000. All of the limited production vehicles came with a Silver Rose Metallic exterior and burgundy plaid cloth interior.      The Turbo S received the M 44.52 engine as opposed to the M 44.51 engine of the earlier models. The engine itself remained essentially unchanged from the early 1988 models. However, the turbocharger was changed to a K-26#8. The Turbo S was electronically limited to the same maximum boost (1.75 bar) as the early 944 Turbos. Also both models achieve maximum boost at approximately 3000 rpm. However, the K-26#8 turbocharger was capable of maintaining maximum boost until 5800 rpm while the boost on the early turbos would decrease from 1.75 bar at 3000 rpm to 1.52 bar at 5800 rpm. This resulted in a 30 hp increase in peak horsepower and a 15 ft-lb. Increase in peak torque.   Performance Comparisons 944 Turbo (M 44.51) 944 Turbo S (M 44.52) Horsepower 217 HP @ 5800 rpm 247 HP @ 6000 rpm Torque 243 ft-lbs. @ 3500 rpm 258 ft-lbs. @ 4000 rpm 0-60 mph 6.1 sec. 5.5 sec. Top Speed 152 mph 162 mph     The Turbo S transaxle came standard with a limited slip differential. However, there were improvements to the differential over previous models. The Turbo S differentials have inner plates which are 2.5 mm thick as opposed to 2.0 mm on earlier models. This required the two differential thrust rings to be made 0.5 mm thinner for the same overall thickness. Also, the inner plate and differential shafts are molybdenum coated for additional hardness. The clutch had a two-stage torsional spring damper with the friction material being bonded and riveted to the clutch disc instead of just rivets on earlier models.      The wheels on the Turbos were milled forged 7J x 16 in front and 9J x 16 in the rear (52.3 mm offset). The tires were 225/50 VR 16s in front and 245/45 VR 16s in the rear. The M 030 suspension package was standard equipment on the Turbo S models as well as ABS. 3.4  1989 / 1990 Model Year      For the 1989 and 1990 model years very few changes were made to the 944 Turbo. 1990 was the last year the 944 Turbo was imported to the United States with less that 150 cars imported to the US that year.      The only real differences between the 1989 and 1990 model year cars and the 944 Turbo S was the size of the wheels used. While the 1989 models still had 7J x 16 and 9J x 16 wheels with the same size cutout as the Turbo S wheels, the offset was changed to 65 mm in front and 60 mm rear. Also available were wheels with smaller cutouts at 7J x 16 front with a 65 mm offset and 8J x 16 rear with a 52.3 mm offset. For the 1990 model year, the wheels were 7.5J x 16 with a 65 mm offset in front and 9J x 16 with a 52.3mm offset in the rear. 3.5  1991 Model Year      As the saying goes, &quot;all good things must come to an end&quot;. The end came for the 944 Turbo in 1991. However, Porsche sent the 944 Turbo out in style by introducing a 944 Turbo Cabriolet in the first half of the 1991 model year. Exact figures on the number of cars produced for the 1991 model year vary greatly. However, there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 875 cars total produced in 1991*. Of those there were approximately 525 cabriolets produced with 255 exported outside Germany.      Due to lack of a hard top, additional chassis stiffening was required on the Cabriolet. This along with the electric motor used to raise the top, the Cabriolet is actually 110 pounds heavier than the Coupe. However, the added weight apparently did not significantly affect the car's performance. Also, the windshield was lowered by 2.4 inches and raked back 0.6 inches to the rear to reduce the wind noise with the top down.      The top is raised by electric motors, but must be latched by hand using two handles located in the cassette storage bin. The car was shod with 17&quot; wheels sporting 225/50 and 245/45 tires. The M030 suspension package, ABS, and limited slip differential were all standard equipment. Note: Most of the information on the 944 Turbo Cabriolet comes from Jerry Sloniger's article in the October 1991 issue of Excellence. Please read Jerry's article if you'd like to learn more about the Cabriolet. *  From the 924/944/968 FAQ. 4.0  General Description of the Turbocharger and Boost Control System Operation 4.1  Foreword      The information in this section is taken from a number of different sources including articles in Panorama, Excellence, the 944 Turbo Workshop Manual, some of my own experience, and different versions of the 944 Turbo Problem FAQ that are being maintained by devoted Porschephiles. 4.2  Turbocharger      As previously mentioned, the stock 944 Turbo uses a KKK K-26#6 turbocharger for the '86-88 model cars (engine M 44.51) and a K-26#8 turbocharger for the 88½-91 model cars (engine M 44.52). For KKK turbochargers, the size of the compressor housing is designated by the first number (K-26) and the size of the turbine or &quot;hot house&quot; is indicated by the second number (#6 or #8 in this case). As we mentioned before, the larger turbine of the K-26#8 allows it to maintain maximum boost longer than the earlier cars which results in a higher peak torque and horsepower.      The turbocharger is supplied from the car's exhaust via an insulated two-to-one crossover pipe. The exhaust headers are also insulated to prevent the exhaust's energy from being lost before it reaches the turbine. On the compressor side the air inlet comes from a plastic pipe connected to a pocket in the left fender well, through the air filter housing, through a &quot;barn door&quot; type air flow sensor, and a rubber inlet plenum boot to the turbocharger compressor. The compressor discharge goes to an air-to-air intercooler which is mounted underneath the nose panel between the headlights and back to the throttle body at the intake manifold. 4.2  Wastegate      The wastegate on a turbocharged car performs two functions. First, it limits the speed of the turbocharger to keep it from destroying itself. Second, it limits boost pressure to prevent damage to the engine. How does it do this? When the wastegate opens, it bypass part of the exhaust flow around the turbocharger turbine, limiting the speed of the turbine and the amount of boost it can produce. On some cars, the wastegate is built into the turbine casing on the turbocharger. However, the 944 Turbo uses an external wastegate. The wastegate is attached to a collector pipe which taps off the crossover pipe from the exhaust headers to the turbo. The wastegate discharge line taps into the exhaust just downstream of the catalytic converter. The wastegate discharge line also contains a small catalytic converter.      The valve portion of the 951 wastegate is almost identical to an intake or exhaust valve on your cylinder head. The valve stem is threaded into a spring-loaded diaphragm that sits on top of the wastegate body. The spring pressure of the diaphragm pulls upward on the valve stem to hold it against its closed seat. Exhaust pressure enters the side of the wastegate body (on the stem side of the valve) and acts to try and force the valve off its closed seat. The top of the diaphragm assembly also contains a chamber which has a pressure line attached to a solenoid boost control valve which is referred to as the cycling valve. 4.3  Cycling Valve      The cycling valve on the 951 is located underneath the intake manifold. It has three ports. One port is connected to the inlet side of the turbocharger between the air flow meter and the turbocharger, one to the discharge of the turbocharger via a banjo bolt on the discharge pipe to the intercooler, and the aforementioned line going to the wastegate diaphragm. Normally, the cycling valve is &quot;open&quot; which allows the pressure from the turbocharger discharge to be bled back to the turbocharger inlet. This is possible because the port on the cycling valve coming from the turbocharger discharge has an orifice in it. When the cycling valve moves toward the &quot;closed&quot; position, it is closing off the port to the turbocharger inlet. This allows pressure from the turbocharger outlet to pass through the cycling valve to the line going to the wastegate diaphragm. This causes pressure to build up on top of the wastegate diaphragm. When the combined pressure on top of the diaphragm and exhaust pressure against the valve seat overcome the spring pressure in the diaphragm, the wastegate will open bypassing the exhaust flow around the turbocharger thereby limiting boost pressure.      The cycling valve is controlled by the KLR Unit (Knock Regulator Unit). The KLR receives signals both directly and from the DME Control Unit to determine how the cycling valve should be controlled. The chips in the KLR have a boost limit which comes preset from the factory. When the actual boost reaches the computers preset limit, the KLR sends a signal to the cycling valve to close which allows exhaust pressure to open the wastegate. If the cycling valve fails, loses power, or a problem occurs in the KLR unit, the cycling valve will fail fully closed. In this mode boost is limited to approximately 1.2 bar. This is essentially the boost at which the force of the exhaust pressure will overcome the wastegate diaphragm spring pressure. 5.0  Common 944 Turbo Questions 5.1  What does the boost gauge reading on my dash mean? The 944 Turbo boost gauge reads the absolute pressure on the car's intake manifold. That means that the gauge not only reads boost pressure, but indicates vacuum in the intake manifold when the car is &quot;off boost&quot;. So, when the gauge reads less than 1 bar, there is a vacuum in the intake manifold and the turbocharger isn't providing any forced flow to the cylinders. Above, 1 bar, the turbo is providing positive forced air flow to the engine. By comparison, the 911 Turbo indication is gauge pressure which means that it only indicates when the turbo is &quot;on boost&quot;. 5.2  What is the maximum boost I should see on my boost gauge? This has long been a point of contention among 944 Turbo owners. For early 944 Turbos, I've heard ranges from 1.7 - 1.75 bar while the numbers for the Turbo S cars range from 1.75 - 185 bar. However, the factory shop manual clearly states that the maximum boost for both models is 1.75 bar. &quot;Maximum boost pressure of 1.75 bar (absolute pressure) is reached at approximately 3,000 rpm. At higher engine speeds (engine type M 44.51) the boost pressure drops off again and reaches a boost pressure of 1.52 ±0.03 bar (absolute pressure) at 5,800 rpm. With engine type M 44.52, the boost pressure remains constant at 5,800 rpm (1.75 bar absolute pressure) and drops only after this value has been passed.&quot; M 44.51 1986-1988 Model 944 Turbos M 44.52 1988.5-1989 Model 944 Turbos There does seem to be some variance between models, but I don't know that anyone's ever actually proven if the later model cars produce a higher maximum boost. The factory does indicate that there is a 10% tolerance at maximum indicated boost. So, that means that the indicated maximum boost could range anywhere from 1.58 bar to 1.93 bar. Start looking for problems if your maximum boost is consistently less than 1.6 bar. 5.3  I hear a humming noise under the hood after I turn the ignition off. Is that normal? The noise you hear is the turbocharger cooling pump. You should hear it run every time you turn the ignition off. The pump also works off a temperature sensor mounted in the turbo cooling water outlet line. However, the pump relay has a timer which will run the pump for 30 seconds after the car has been turned off regardless of temperature. 6.0  944 Turbo Problems 6.1  Foreword      This section of the FAQ deals with problems that 944 Turbo owners have experienced in the past. This information is taken from the 944 Turbo Problems FAQ which was originally developed by Chris Mellor. There were a number of contributors to the FAQ including Jim Dresser, Chris Hanlon, Clark Archer, Stu (?), Farzaan Kassam, Bob Tucker, and many others. 6.2  Turbo Does Not Boost Correctly It boosts to a level and will not go any higher It does not produce any turbo pressure at all It produces varying boost depending upon the gear you are in. (See 6.2.5 Other Mechanical Problems below - the kinked throttle cable problem.) Diagnostic Suggestions: Clamp off the line from the cycling valve to the wastegate and drive the car. This will close the wastegate and direct all the exhaust to the exhaust turbine. Now drive the car but do NOT fully depress the throttle. Just go over 3,000 rpm to see if the turbo boost is working. (If it is and you depress the accelerator a lot then the turbo could spin too fast and over-boost the engine causing damage.) If the car then boosts OK it means that the cycling valve and line are where the problem lies. The wastegate is not being controlled properly. This could mean that the cycling valve is being given bad information due to a faulty DME, knock sensor or 'control units' or is faulty itself. If the car doesn't boost properly then look for: A mechanical problem with the turbo A leak or other problem in the air intake system The wastegate sticking open A leak in the exhaust system Other mechanical problems Engine computer problems These checks should point you in the right direction. Other diagnostic checks: Does the car only boost up to 0.2bar or 1.2bar absolute? If yes, then it's a likely problem with a connection on one of the various sensors (TPS, airflow meter, etc). Hook up an after-market boost gauge to get an idea of what the turbo is actually doing. (The turbo could actually be working but a slipping clutch could absorb all the turbo boost and make it seem as if there is no turbo effect.) The after-market boost gauge measures turbo boost pressure before the air enters the intercooler. 6.2.1  Mechanical Turbo Problems Pull off the turbo intake hose and check for freedom of movement in the turbo. The turbo unit itself may be broken. E.g. the compressor wheel could be broken. 6.2.2  Air Intake Problems Look for a vacuum leak. A vacuum leak will be a boost leak once the turbo spools up. Make sure all the vacuum lines are not cracked, corroded or brittle. Check along the intake manifold system between the pressure side of the turbo and the inlet manifold. Check the rubber Y-connectors on the intake manifold for leaks. Look at the rubber connector boost (boot?) on the intercooler pipes, Check the rubber boot coming out of the turbo to the metal intercooler pipe Check the compressor bypass valve (air cut-off valve as Porsche call it) located on the rubber boot just before the throttle body. A vacuum line goes to the top of it. If the valve fails and is stuck open, the boost from the turbo will just re-circulate around the turbo and not get to the engine. A (timing valve fault may cause boost to be limited to Suggestion: Disconnect the timing valve. It is located between cylinders 3-4 just under the intake manifold. It has three hoses attached to it and an electrical connector at the top. (The top is white). To check if it works, place a stethoscope (automotive) on the top of the valve with the engine running. Then very quickly throttle the car past 60% and listen for a clicking sound on the valve. It sounds like a very fast &quot;blap/blap/blap&quot;. You have to do this very quickly because you do not want to over-rev the engine. The valve is controlled by the KLR. If the intercooler was full of oil or somehow blocked it could limit the turbo boost. Note. Leaks in the inlet manifold area should trigger a blink code. However, if they are very small leaks then pressure could leak out but the leak not register via the blink code. Suggestion: Have the Porsche specialist shop force a fault to make the blink code work. E.g. remove the throttle connector and it should start blinking. IF it does that tells you that the KLR is somewhat working. Check all inlet piping extremely carefully for a leak. Even the tiniest crack will reduce boost to nothing. Make sure the intercooler is not split, corroded or cracked. 6.2.3  Wastegate Problems You have to use pressure to make the wastegate open. With the car idling the by-pass pipe should be cold or just a little warm. Use a hand vacuum/pressure pump to check to see it the wastegate is working. Hook the vacuum/Pressure pump to the wastegate and apply max .5 bar of pressure. The pressure will open the wastegate and release the hot gases into the by-pass pipe. If the pipe gets warm the wastegate is working. If the pipe starts out hot then the valve is stuck open. If the by-pass pipe is disconnected because you are replacing the gaskets (do not start the engine unless all the exhaust is connected.) you can watch the valve open. There is a membrane controlling the valve so use no more than .5 bar (7lbs) of pressure. Check proper operation of the wastegate using a vacuum pump. Check the vacuum hose off the rear of the engine that goes to the wastegate for a leak. Check that the wastegate is not stuck open. Check that the wastegate hose is the correct size. If too big it can leak and cause faulty wastegate behavior. 6.2.4  Exhaust System Leaks Check with a hose type stethoscope. Check there are no exhaust leaks from the header. Make sure there are no cracks in the turbo's exhaust housing. If you have a catalytic converter make sure that it is not clogged. 6.2.5  Other Mechanical Problems A kink in the throttle cable can stop the turbo from spooling properly. One car car produced 2 bar at full throttle in first gear, but 2nd through 5th would not produce anything. This was because the throttle cable was kinked. The fault also seemed to get worse as the car warms up. A faulty throttle switch can stop the turbo spooling properly. There could be a bad connection due to corrosion on the throttle position switch (located on the throttle body, forward of the intake manifold). On one side is a cable that controls the throttle opening, and on the other side is a black plastic switch that reads the throttle position. The connection to this device can become corroded. Typically moving around the connector a bit will fix the problem temporarily. Disassembling the connector, cleaning and putting on a coat of dielectric grease on it will fix the problem semi-permanently. The timing belt may have slipped a tooth and the engine is thus retarded. An oil trap leak can drop the boost. Check the cycling valve connections. If they are corroded or broken off, the car will only register 0.2bar (1.2bar absolute) and will give no error codes. 6.2.6 Engine Computer Problems The 944 Turbo engine is controlled by a Bosch Motronic DME unit. It links to a KLR turbo control unit. If either of these units are faulty then the turbo may not behave correctly. A Bosch diagnostic unit can be connected to the DME box and interrogate it. If the DME has detected a fault it may return a fault code to the Bosch diagnostic system which describes the fault when it is decoded. A DME unit can perform incorrectly due to broken solder joints and/or broken/bent pins in the plug which connects it to the rest of the engine and its sensors. A new Bosch Motronic unit is c £1,100 in the UK ($1,000 in the USA?). A re-conditioned unit is c £400. There are service operations, such as Network 500 Ltd in the UK, which diagnose and recondition engine brains. 6.3  More Pronounced Turbo Lag. Check the vacuum pipe which connects to the top of the air recirculating valve. It is also referred to as the blow-off or pop-off valve. A failure in the valve can cause this pipe to be blown off the valve. The vacuum connector then does not do its work. The valve's function is to prevent a sudden slowdown of the turbine compressor wheel when the throttle is let go. If you then re-accelerate you would have to wait for the compressor wheel to spool up to high speed again - turbo lag. When the throttle is closed (accelerator pedal released) a vacuum occurs in the inlet manifold. This vacuum is detected by the air recirculating valve via the vacuum pipe. This valve opens and causes the compressed air coming out of the turbo to flow back into the turbocharger's air inlet space thus recirculating the compressed air and maintaining turbo compressor wheel speed. The air recirculating or dump valve is located on top of the large diameter ribbed plastic pipe which goes between the airflow meter unit and the input side of the turbocharger. The vacuum pipe goes between the valve top and a 'T' piece close to the regulator valve on front of the fuel rail. Testing the valve requires you to remove it. Unfasten two hose clamps, pull off the vacuum pipe and move the valve out and away from the air pipes attached to it. Clean the two air pipe connections on the valve and blow hard down each air connection while feeling for air leaks from the other connections. There should be no leaks. If there are it means that a diaphragm inside the valve has failed. A new valve costs about £20.00. 6.4  Turbo Overboosts Problem statement: By far the biggest problem (at least so it seams) with my new 951 is that it cuts the fuel VERY abruptly during heavy acceleration. It is almost like someone is hitting the brakes! It usually happens around 4000rpm but will not occur if I just accelerate &quot;normally&quot;. Also, my boost gauge is stuck at one when the engine is on (it returns to 0 when engine is turned off). I believe I can hear the turbo spinning during the acceleration so somehow the boost gauge must be connected wrong? Second Problem statement: The car idles and runs fine, as long as you don't get on the boost hard. If you floor it, the boost gauge goes up to about 1.8, then, a couple of seconds later, the car jerks hard, and the boost goes away (fuel shut off??). I believe that either the cycling valve or the wastegate isn't working. Is there any way to check out which of these 2 items isn't working? Does anyone know of better designed parts to replace these? Diagnosis 1: This is an overboost situation. One of the most common causes of overboost is the pressure line leading from the wastegate. A crack here will cause overboost for sure the DME then shuts off the fuel. This hose is rubber & can dry rot over time. Diagnosis 2: You have a broken vacuum/boost line (hose) between the intake manifold between cylinders 3 and 4 and the KLR (Turbo control computer) box in the passenger footwell, or your KLR box is broken. If this hose is somehow cut or is leaking, the KLR will be reading atmospheric pressure, which will result in no real power for you. The KLR doesn't know how much boost, so goes into overboost protection mode (which is the abrupt cutoff of boost.) Diagnosis 3: One possibility is that the connection to your air flow meter needs to be cleaned. The next is your wastegate is stuck. The next is that you have a leak in your lines going to the wastegate so that it doesn't measure the proper boost from the turbo and keeps letting boost build. Result: your DME/KLR will shut down the fuel so you don't blow your head gasket and you fly through the windshield. Inspect your hoses to and from the wastegate and cycling valve. 6.5  Turbo Pump/Fan Failure Problem statement: I have a 1988 turbo S and I haven't heard the turbo water pump come on for some time. Temperature on the engine stays on the cool end when running (2nd mark) and goes up to the 3rd mark after the engine is shut off (after the fans have come on). Is the turbo water pump supposed to run for 30 seconds or so, or is it temperature regulated? How should it act? Diagnosis 1: It should come on period. If it does not you are shortening the life of your turbo. Check it directly by disconnecting the wires and jumping it with a hot it should come on. If not check the relay(G19 on an '86 944 Turbo). If these things do not help then replace the part. Your turbo needs it. I replaced mine ($100) along with all the hoses leading to it. It took the better part of a Saturday but was well worth it. Diagnosis 2: The turbo water pump should run for ~30 seconds after shut off independent of coolant temp. It is possible that the pump is binding and that loosening the hoses and adjusting things will free it up. Check the 944 FAQ for more on that subject. 6.6  Fitting A Boost Gauge. Statement: I want to install a VDO boost gauge in my 951. I have it already mounted in the console and now need to do the vacuum line connection. Response 1: There is a banjo bolt on the intake manifold just above and slightly forward of the cycling valve. The cycling valve is between cylinders 3 and 4, under the intake manifold (round, cream colored about the size of a ½ dollar). This banjo bolt has a vacuum line leading from it, with a T or Y connector (3 way) in the line. I replaced that Y connector with an X connector (4 way) and simply hooked the VDO gauge plumbing to that connector, and reconnected the other vacuum lines to it. You should be able to find an X connector of the proper size at (in the USA) Western Auto or other parts house. You will have to get flexible tubing to connect the hard tubing from the gauge to the X connector. Response 2: The boost gauge can be hooked up by using a &quot;T&quot; connector to tap into the vacuum line from the intake manifold to the KLR control unit. This nice thing about connecting here is that it minimizes the length of the vacuum line required for the hook up and you don't have to worry about running the vacuum line through the firewall. With the vacuum line on the 944 Turbo, you can use a 1/4&quot; compression fitting. However, it will be a tight fit an you'll have to work at it to get the compression nut and ferrule on the tubing. Most aftermarket boost gauges can be purchased with a hook up kit. They can come with varying sizes of tubing, but most I've seen come with 1/8&quot; hard plastic tubing and usually come with a compression fitting. Be careful when tighten the compression nut for the 1/8&quot; tubing because the 1/8&quot; compression ferrules crush very easily. 6.7  Turbo Pump Stays On When Engine Running Statement: I cleaned the '87 951 engine compartment today with a pressure hose and as usual something goes awry. The turbo pump now stays on after the car is started. If the relay (G22) is removed (car is not running) the pump will stop after the relay is re-inserted. However the next time the car is started the pump will run on again. Disconnecting and reconnecting the two pin connector has no effect - other than stopping and starting the pump. BTW it is only about 15 minutes after the wash and I am hoping the problem will disappear after everything has dried. I hope the Porsche Gods are listening (compassionately - yeah!). I have done the following with no effect: Cleaned the connector contacts (near the shock towers) Rapped the relay and cleaned the relay contacts Diagnosis: Sounds like you damaged the thermo switch for the pump. It is mounted into the turbo water pipe, look for a single wire connector with a black Bakelite covering. If you disconnect this switch and the turbo water pump does not immediately start when you turn on the ignition (without starting the engine), then that is your culprit. 6.8  Random Boost Fall Problem. Statement: I own a 1986 944 Turbo that I bought with 71K miles. Shortly after buying the car I began experiencing problems with the turbo boosting. It will happen randomly and always at a bad time. The problem consists of the turbo only boosting to 1.2 bar rather than the usual 1.8 bar. This becomes extremely annoying while trying to pass on a country road. The problem cures itself when the engine is shut off and immediately started again. I have tried shutting it down and starting several times while coasting into toll booths and I have never had a problem after the restart. About seven months ago I took the car to a Porsche Dealer. The mechanics worked on the car for two hours, which included a few calls to other dealerships. Unfortunately, they could not find the problem. Also has a rough cold idle. Diagnosis 1: To really nail this down, one would want to do a complete checkout of your exhaust system, consider removing the turbocharger and re-gasket it, and evaluate the waste gate. Putting it on a dyno could help, too, because you could evaluate the exhaust gases at the same time. One reason for the loss of boost can be lack of fuel - leaning - which would be picked up by the sniffer. If fuel were the problem, it could be related to failing fuel pressure regulators on the fuel rail, or a vacuum leak which would compromise the effectiveness of the fuel enrichment system. The frustrating part of this sort of thing is that it is still intermittent, and probably did not show itself to the shop you took it to. Diagnosis 2: Your problem could be a bad throttle position sensor. The fact that the problem goes away after restart would tend to confirm it. My 87 951 had the same problem early in its life. Solution: The problem turned out to be the KLR chip. 6.9  Excessive Heat From Intake Manifold Statement: I have a technical problem. It's a 951 '86, and I just removed the turbo and replaced all seals in the area. Everything runs like a charm, great power and smooth idle. But, I notice rich running and EXCESSIVE heat coming from the intake manifold. At first, I said it was the turbo heating up. But the water temp is not at all high, in fact it just barely simmers at ½ way on the gauge as usual. The intake manifold is so hot it can't be touched after is stops running. The DME is running the mixture rich to cool things down. But what is causing the heat? Diagnosis 1: Sounds like you damaged the thermo switch for the pump. It is mounted into the turbo water pipe, look for a single wire connector with a black Bakelite covering. If you disconnect this switch and the turbo water pump does not immediately start when you turn on the ignition (without starting the engine), then that is your culprit. 6.10  Turbo Oil Leak. Statement: My '86 944T produces an oily smell from the exhaust when accelerating moderately-hard. (Although no smoke is visible). There is no smoke/smell at start-up but the first time the engine is revved there is some oil smoke which clears quickly. (This only happens when the car has stood over-night). I suspect oil is getting into the engine from the turbo as the air pipes leading from the turbo charger to intercooler to inlet manifold have considerable oil deposits in them. Puddles of oil are evident at the low points along the route, e.g. at connections in/out on intercooler and at throttle body. If I clean out the pipes the smell goes away for a day but then returns, together with the oil. The oil is not coming from the breather pipe as I temporarily disconnected it and plugged the hole left in the intake. Leak-down test has shown that all is well with cylinders. The valve guides/seals have recently been replaced during top-end overhaul - it made no difference. The problem has slowly got worse over the past 18 months. I suspect turbo bearing/seal. Diagnosis? 6.11  Cycling Valve Not Working Properly. Statement: The cycling valve on my 951 is not working properly. The valve is ok (tested), but it never gets any signal from the computer. The valve should open when the air flap in the air flow sensor swings +60=B0. Since no signal is coming from the computer (wiring and pressure line seem ok), I was wondering what the origin of this problem can be. Apart from a fault in the computer, which sensor inputs can result in no signal to the cycling valve (knock sensor, etc...)? Diagnosis? 6.12  Turbo Oil Consumption. Statement: I have found that the more I use my turbo, the more oil I consume, by a big margin. When I first got the car, I drove very conservative and used/lost about ½ qt in 1500 miles or 1 in 3000. When pushing the car a lot, I find that my consumption has been as much as 1 qt in 600 miles. Is this common, or what may be my problem? The car is an 86 turbo with 115k on it, 150 compression across all 4 cylinders. Over boosts also. 6.13  Oil In The Intercooler. Statement: Should there or should there not be oil in the tubes going to and from the intercooler? There are no puddles just a film of oil on the inside surfaces. Is this normal or an indication that the turbo seals are going bad. This 86 951 has only 50K original miles and I hope a turbo rebuild isn't required just yet. Answer: It is normal for there to be a light film of oil there. Over time the oil will also coat the intercooler, reducing intercooler efficiency. You will want to want to clean the intercooler out from time to time as the build-up increases. 6.14  Boost Rises Then Falls Statement: I have a weird problem with my '86 951. As I depress the gas pedal, I see the boost rise, but just when it should give me that power kick, I actually experience a power loss - it feels as though I had downshifted. My current theory is that the boost is somehow not available at the intake manifold, but the onboard computer thinks it is and begins to inject more fuel into the air stream - causing a power loss because the air/fuel ratio gets messed up. But I really fail to see how it is that the boost is not making it to the intake. Diagnosis: There are several things you can try to fix this: Unplug the air meter box connector and clean the connector off. Check for unplugged vacuum hoses Check the idle speed screw, see if you have one (I don't know if they fall out or just get forgotten) What is happening I think, and this seems to be a common problem, is that the computer thinks you have an overboost situation and is shutting the fuel down. Now, you may have a real problem. The wastegate may be stuck, the timing valve may not have power etc.., so if you can't find the fix take it to a trustworthy mechanic. It took me a year and several mechanics to actually fix my problem. In the meantime, one had me replace the computers, one told me my wastegate was stuck, &quot;bla bla bla&quot;.

Back then it was the 911 Turbo, which was introduced the year I got my driver's license. I've owned many sports cars over the years and I've loved every one of them. My first sports car was a 1967 MGB. I was constantly fiddling with it, but that was just part of the joy of owning an MG. I subsequently owned a 1967 MGB, 1974 MGB, 1977 MG Midget, and a 1968 Jaguar XKE Roadster. In 1979, I finally kicked the British car habit. It was beginning to make me suicidal. In the December of 1992, my &quot;sports car&quot; was a 1988 Mustang GT. It was a lot fun but, as many people have come to realize, is also an extremely dangerous car --- good horsepower---poor suspension---no brakes. One day while I was at work a good friend of mine and I decided to drive into town for lunch. When we got to the parking lot, he tossed me the keys to his newly acquired 1985½ 944 Euro and asked me if I wanted to try it out. Well, my Mustang was posted in the classified section of the local paper the next day. And on January 27, 1993, thanks to my friend Koda, I purchased my first and, as of this publication, only Porsche --- a 1986 944 Turbo. If I had my way, I'd own one of every Porsche model ever built. But, until I hit the lottery, I'll have to settle for one (or two). This page is for everyone who owns or is considering the purchase of a 944 or 944 Turbo. I'd still like to have a 911 Turbo someday but, if it means giving up my 944 Turbo, I'll never own one.

Personally, I have not had the opportunity to use this procedure yet. So, for now, we have to assume that the factory procedure works as written. If you attempt to use this procedure and determine that changes need to be made, please let me know. The airbag system has an internal diagnostics system which continuously monitors the condition of the system. Any faults in the system are indicated by an &quot;Airbag&quot; warning light on the instrument cluster. When the ignition is turned on and when the engine is started, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light illuminates and remains lit for 5 seconds. If no faults in the system are detected, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light will then extinguish. Testing the air bag system will require you to make up a test rig to apply a ground to the air bag test connector. The Air Bag Warning Light Reset procedure ( ELECT-12) contains instructions for fabricating the test rig. After the ground is applied to the test connector, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light will blink in a series of codes to indicate the faults stored in the system's memory. It takes approximately 2 minutes to detect all faults once the test is started. Therefore, the ignition switch must be on for at least 2 minutes during the test. Tools Improvised Test Rig Pen and paper for recording fault codes Procedure Turn the ignition switch off. Connect the test rig from the airbag molex test connector to ground. Depress and hold the switch/pushbutton on the test. Turn the ignition switch on. Release the test rig pushbutton 3 seconds after the ignition switch is turned on. Count and record the lamp blink codes. The lamp blink codes will run as follows: 5 second lamp test. Light flashes 1 or more times depending on the number of faults. After 3 seconds the fault codes will start. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the fault code group. 3 second pause. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the line in the fault table. 3 second pause. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the column in the fault table. 3 second pause. Light flashes 1 or 2 times. 1 = Short-time fault 2 = Long-time fault 3 second pause. Next fault code sequence starts. Air bag light remains lit at the end of the test. Using the lamp code table, determine the system faults and take corrective actions as described in the &quot;Correcting Faults&quot; section. After all testing is complete and all faults have been corrected, reset the airbag warning light ( ELECT-12). The flash code test may be repeated as often as desired.

However, to my knowledge it first appeared in the 944 FAQ which is now maintained by Kevin Gross. If anyone knows who originally came up with this, please pass the info along so I can provide appropriate credit. This procedure is used to reset the air bag warning light on all 944s equipped with air bags. This is normally required when the steering wheel (and hence the air bag) are removed for work on the dash, instrument cluster, or steering column switches. This procedure does not work for 968s as they require a Bosch Hammer diagnostic tool to reset the air bag warning light. Under the dash on the passenger's side of the vehicle (LHD cars), you'll find a white Molex connector with three female pins (diagram below). The center pin (Pin #2) is used to apply a ground to the connector in a series of specific timed steps to reset the air bag warning light. You can use a wire with a pin connector to make the ground connection or the bare end off a wire that has been tinned with solder. In either case, make sure you have a good connection in the pin (i.e. if using the bare end of a wire make sure the fit is snug enough that the wire will not fall out). Tools One jumper with pin connector (may use bare wire tinned with solder instead) on one end and alligator clip on the other (approximately 3 feet long) One jumper with alligator clips on both ends (approximately 3 feet long) Stop watch, watch with a sweep second hand, or digital watch that displays seconds Alternative Tool This tool is an alternative to the two jumper arrangement. Khalil Spencer came up with the idea for this test rig. The tool is shown in the diagram below. All of the components are available at an electronics store (Radio Shack, for example). You may have to try several different sizes of pin connectors to find the correct size to fit in the hole on the air bag reset Molex connector (see introduction for location of connector). You can also obtain the correct connector from Porsche (PN 171.971.998 B). Alternatively, you can also leave the pin connector end off and tin the end of the The pushbutton switch is a momentary contact switch (SPST Momentary). In other words, it is spring loaded and the switch is closed as long as the button is pushed. The switch opens when the button is released. Procedure (Two Jumpers) Turn the ignition switch to the off position. Install the jumper with the pin connector or bare end of wire into Pin #2 of the white Molex connector (passenger's side under dash). Route the alligator clip end of the jumper to the vicinity of the driver's seat. Install the second jumper (two alligator clips) to a grounding point (metal door latch is typically used). Route the other end of the jumper to the vicinity of the driver's seat. Note: During the reset procedure you will be connecting and disconnecting the alligator clips from the two jumpers to provide a ground on the center pin of the Molex connector. Connect the alligator clip ends of the two jumpers. Turn the ignition switch to the on (run) position but, do not start the car. After five seconds, disconnect the wire jumpers. Wait another five seconds. Reconnect the jumpers to ground Pin #2. After five seconds, disconnect the jumpers and turn the ignition switch off. Remove all the jumpers. Start the car. The air bag warning light should clear after approximately 10 seconds. If the light does not clear repeat the procedure. If, after three attempts, the light does not clear, there is most likely a problem with the air bag system which needs to be repaired. It is possible to read the fault codes for the air bag system using a similar procedure. I'm working on that procedure and hope to have it in the near future. Procedure (Test Rig) Turn the ignition switch to the off position. Install the test rig with the pin connector bare end of wire into Pin #2 of the white Molex connector (passenger's side under dash). Connect the other end of the test rig (alligator clip) to a grounding point (metal door latch is typically used). Depress and hold the pushbutton on the test rig. Turn the ignition switch to the on (run) position but, do not start the car. When the ignition has been on for five seconds, release the test rig pushbutton. After five seconds, again depress the pushbutton on the test rig and hold for five seconds. Release the pushbutton and turn the ignition switch off. Remove the test rig. Start the car. The air bag warning light should clear after approximately 10 seconds. If the light does not clear repeat the procedure. If, after three attempts, the light does not clear, there is most likely a problem with the air bag system which needs to be repaired.

Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[23]=new Array("shop-manual/hvac-02.htm","Air Conditioning Troubleshooting and Repair","","HVAC-02, Air Conditioning Troubleshooting and Repair Acrobat Printable Version Introduction Since I'm constantly receiving questions on 944 air conditioning systems, I figured it's time to come up with come helpful troubleshooting tips. Working on the 944 A/C system is no different than working on any other automotive A/C system. They have all the same components which function in the same manner as any other A/C system. First, if you're having a problem with the A/C system on your 944, there are two ways you can approach solving the problem. The first is to just start replacing components and hope you get lucky by replacing the faulty component the first time. The other method involves doing some actual testing to narrow down the cause of the problem. In order to properly test the A/C system and narrow down the possible causes of your problem, you're going to have to invest in a set of A/C gauges. Before we begin with the actual troubleshooting, to properly troubleshoot the A/C system, it's extremely helpful to understand how the automobile A/C cycle works. So, we'll begin by discussing automotive air conditioning theory of operation. There are two basic types of automotive air conditioning systems. The type of system is determined by the device used to control the expansion of the high pressure, high temperature liquid to a low pressure, low temperature liquid. One system uses and expansion valve while the other uses an orifice tube. 944s use an expansion valve system. We'll discuss the operation of both. The first component in the A/C cycle is the compressor. The compressor takes low temperature refrigerant gas and compresses it into a high pressure, high temperature gas. The refrigerant is then sent to the condenser which sits in front of the radiator. The condenser removes some of the heat from the refrigerant which causes the refrigerant to change phase from a hot gas to a warm liquid. In the expansion valve A/C system, the warm liquid is then passed through a receiver-drier which removes moisture (via a desiccant in the drier) from the refrigerant to maximize the efficiency of the heat exchange capability of the refrigerant. On 944s, the receiver-drier is a small canister (probably with a sightglass on top) located near behind the driver's side headlight (LHD cars). No phase change occurs as the refrigerant passes through the receiver-drier. From there, the refrigerant is then passed through the expansion valve. The expansion valve has a sensing line that is attached to the suction of the A/C compressor. The expansion valve senses the pressure at the suction of the A/C compressor and modulates to maintain the pressure at the compressor suction. On 944s, the expansion valve is located near in the passenger's footwell (LHD cars) near the center console next to the firewall. In the orifice tube system, the warm liquid refrigerant passes directly from the condenser to the orifice tube. The orifice tube is a fixed expansion device. The pressure drop across the orifice tube is proportional to the pressure into the orifice tube. So, the orifice tube system maintains the pressure at the suction of the A/C compressor by cycling the compressor on and off via a clutch. This is the type of system typically used by GM vehicles. The expansion of the warm liquid through the expansion valve or orifice tube causes a pressure drop and hence a temperature drop in the refrigerant. So, out of the expansion device we get a low temperature liquid refrigerant. The next component in the A/C system is the evaporator. Air from the passenger's compartment passes across one side of the coils in the evaporator. The low temperature liquid refrigerant passes through the other side of the coils. The refrigerant removes heat from the air in the passenger's compartment and returns to the A/C compressor suction as a low temperature gas (phase change). In the orifice tube system, there is an accumulator located between the evaporator and the A/C compressor suction. The accumulator has moisture removal desiccant just like the receiver-drier used in the expansion valve system. However, it also collects any un-evaporated refrigerant to prevent liquid lock of the compressor. This can occur due to the cycling action of the compressor. The diagrams below show the two different A/C system cycles.     Tools A/C Gauges and hose set A/C System Troubleshooting The following is an general A/C system troubleshooting guide.

Thanks to Tom Harrison for taking the time to provide feedback to correct several mistakes and to make the procedure more user friendly. Tools Medium flat tip screwdriver 10mm socket and ratchet 13mm socket and ratchet 5mm Allen head socket or hex key (TURBO ONLY) 17mm socket and ratchet or 17mm wrench (TURBO ONLY) Flat tip jeweler's screwdriver or straight probe Removal Normally aspirated cars: Remove the air filter cover, filter, and breather hose. It's only necessary to remove the breather hose but, you'll likely find it easier to remove the cover and breather hose together. (Comment from TMH) Loosen the clamp which holds the rubber inlet plenum boot to the air flow sensor. Using the jeweler's screwdriver or straight probe, push back the ends of the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor electrical connector until they rest on the side of the connector. Slide the connector off the plug. NOTE Two electrical wires are secured to the air flow sensor via a small red plastic clip and L-bracket. You can either try to pull the clip from the small L-bracket that it mounts to, or you can remove the L-bracket from the air flow sensor assembly. I recommend the later, as it is a single bolt, and when I attempted to do the former, I broke the red plastic clip. (Comment from TMH) Remove the two 13mm bolts at the front of the air filter housing (attaches the air filter housing to the bracket at the radiator cross-member). (Comment from TMH) Remove the two 10mm bolts at the back of the air filter housing (attaches the air filter housing to a mounting bracket). (Comment from TMH) Lift the air flow sensor and air filter housing out of the car as a unit. Turbocharged cars: On top of the air filter housing, remove the screw for the metal strap that holds the filter housing to the turbocharger discharge to intercooler pipe. Loosen the two clamps on either end of the turbocharger discharge pipe (one behind the air filter housing, one near the top of the radiator). Using a 17mm socket and ratchet or 17mm wrench, remove the banjo bolt on the turbocharger discharge pipe. Be careful when removing the bolt. There are two metal seal rings on either side of the banjo connector that can easily be dropped when the bolt is removed. They can be nasty to retrieve if the fall in the wrong spot. Remove the turbocharger discharge pipe from the car. Using the jeweler's screwdriver or straight probe, push back the ends of the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor electrical connector until they rest on the side of the connector. Slide the connector off the plug. Using the 5mm Allen head socket or hex key, loosen the filter housing retaining bolts. There are actually four bolts. However, due to it being so difficult to remove and install, you may find the last bolt is missing. If it is installed, you'll find it by looking behind the sensor housing on the right side of the air filter housing. Chances are you'll have to remove the top of the air filter housing to even see it. The short end of a 5mm hex key is about the only thing that will access it. Don't completely remove the bolts as it will simplify the installation. Loosen the clamp that holds the rubber inlet plenum boot to the air flow sensor. Lift up on the left side of the air filter housing and slide the entire assembly toward the left side of the car as you lift it out. Some folks remove the filter housing inlet tube prior to removal to make things a little easier. If you wish to do so, remove the two Phillips screws on top of the air filter housing first. Installation Normally aspirated cars: Lower the air flow sensor/air filter housing assembly into the car. Ensure the air flow sensor outlet is inserted into the end of the rubber inlet plenum boot. Locate the filter assembly mounting bracket on to the studs on the upper radiator cross-member. Install and tighten the bracket retaining nuts. Tighten the clamp on the rubber inlet plenum boot for the air flow sensor. Ensure the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor wiring harness connector is properly positioned and slide the connector on to the sensor plug. Connect the breather hose to the air filter housing and tighten clamp. Turbocharged cars: Lower the air filter housing assembly into the car and slide the air flow sensor outlet into the rubber inlet plenum boot. As you lower the air filter housing into the car, the mounting bolts (Allen head) should insert into the notched mounting brackets. This ensures the housing is properly aligned. If your model is equipped with a timing belt cover breather hose, attach the hose to the bottom of the filter housing as you lower the unit into the car. NOTE Later model cars are not equipped with the breather hose and will have the hose connection on the bottom of the housing capped. Also, some early models may still have the attachment on the timing belt cover but, it has been capped as well. If the air filter housing inlet tube was removed install the tube on the housing using the two Phillips head screws. Tighten the air filter housing mounting bolts (Allen head - 5mm) and the clamp for the air flow sensor outlet on the rubber inlet plenum boot. Install the turbocharger discharge pipe. It's easier to install if you insert the end into the rubber hose near the radiator first. Tighten the hose clamps on either end of the tube. Attach the banjo bolt connection to the discharge pipe (17mm wrench or socket). Be sure to install the seal rings on the either side of the banjo bolt connector. On top of the air filter housing, install the metal strap for the turbocharger discharge pipe and attach to the housing using the retaining screw. Ensure the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor wiring harness connector is properly positioned and slide the connector on to the sensor plug.

Also, covered is a procedure for testing the AFM and correcting problems related to erratic operation. If you'd like more detailed information about the operation of the AFM, FR Wilk has written a very comprehensive article on the AFM. The article is located at http://www.frwilk.com/944dme/afm.htm. What I've provided below is simply a summary of that article. Operation There are two different Air Flow Meters used on 944s although externally they are similar in appearance. Both AFMs use a flapper or barn door arrangement where, as air flow through the meter increases, it forces the barn door further open. The movement of the barn door moves a wiper arm across the conducting strip of a variable potentiometer. The sensor has a voltage applied to it which is supplied by the DME computer. As the barn door opens and the wiper arm moves across the variable potentiometer, the output voltage from the AFM increases. This output signal is sent back to the DME to be used as an air flow signal. The primary differences between the early 944 AFM (pre-1985.5) and the late AFM is that the input voltage from the DME computer is different and the type of output signal from the AFM back to the DME computer is different. In both AFMs, the DME uses a ratio of the supply voltage (from the DME) to output voltage (from the AFM) for air flow signal development . The early AFM receives an unregulated 12 VDC supply from the DME. The voltage output from AFM is not proportional to the change in barn door position but instead increases exponentially as the barn door is opened. The output signal is however, proportional to the increase in air flow. Consequently, what the DME receives from the meter is in effect an actual air flow signal. On the later AFMs, the input voltage from the DME is a regulated 5 VDC supply. The output signal from the AFM is a voltage that increases linearly as the barn door opened. What this does is to simplify the construction of the later AFM. However, it now requires the DME to interpolate the input signal from the AFM to obtain an air flow signal. The main problem that occurs with the AFMs over time is that the wiper arm contacts wear grooves in the conducting strip of the variable potentiometer. When that happens it can lead to erratic voltage output from the AFM which will cause the car to hesitate or stumble as you accelerate. In the picture below you can see the potentiometer conducting strip and the grooves in the strip. In the AFM shown the grooves in the strip are not yet bad enough to cause erratic operation of the AFM. NOTE The AFM can be tested in the car. However, it is extremely difficult and I prefer to remove the AFM for testing. Testing the AFM (Installed) Note: Here's a drawing which which shows the terminal numbers. Realize that you're looking into the end of the wiring harness plug. So, the terminals on the AFM plug will be reversed from the terminals show below from the plug. Note: The terminals on the AFM itself are label 1-2-3-4. The terminals on the wiring harness plug correspond as follows: Plug Terminal AFM Terminal Connection 22 1 Air Temperature Sensor 7 2 Output Voltage to DME 9 3 Input Voltage from DME 6 4 Ground Push back the protection sleeve on the air flow sensor connector. The connector remains attached. Connect a voltmeter to terminals 9 and 6 on the back of the connector. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. If you have an early 944 (pre-1985.5), the voltmeter will probably read approximately battery voltage (12 VDC). However, it should read a minimum of 8 VDC. If you have a late model 944, the voltmeter should read 5 VDC +/- 0.5. This is the AFM input voltage. Connect the voltmeter between terminal 7 on the back of the connector and ground. Here you should read 150 - 250 mV. Slowly push the sensor plate (barn door) to the full open position using a not-to-hard, smooth item inserted through the filter intake opening. The voltage should rise to slightly less than the input voltage measured in Step 1. You are measuring the output voltage in this step. The voltage should rise steadily with not drop in voltage or erratic changes in voltage. If this happens, there are dead spots in the AFM potentiometer conducting strip. You may be able to correct this by bending the AFM wiper arm. This will be discussed later. Check temperature sensor I (intake air temperature). Turn the ignition switch off and pull off plug on air flow sensor. Connect and ohmmeter between terminals 6 and 22 on air flow sensor (both outer male terminals on the sensor plug). With air temperature between 15 - 30 °C, the ohmmeter should read 1.45 - 3.3 k-ohms. If the air temperature sensor reads open, it will cause a rich mixture. If it reads a short, it will cause a lean mixture. Test Procedure (AFM Removed) Tools Multimeter Test Leads 9 VDC Battery 9 V Battery Connector Small Female Spade Connectors (2) Electrical Tape Making Up Test Connections To test the AFM with it removed from the car, you'll need a voltage source. The simplest solution to this is a 9 VDC battery. To make up the leads, I went to Radio Shack and obtained a 9 V battery connector which had leads with bare ends connected to it. Next, you'll need to crimp a small female spade connector to each of the bare ends. Again, you'll probably have to go to an electronics store and look for the smallest female spade connectors they have. I had small female spade connectors. However, they were actually one size larger than what I needed. So, I had to wrap the spades with electrical tape to keep the from touching when connected to the AFM connector. Test With the AFM removed from the car, remove the cover from the AFM. It will be glued to the body of the AFM by a bead of silicon sealant. You'll have to cut the sealant bead at the bottom edge of the cover where it mates to body of the AFM. You can use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut the sealant.  Here's a look at the inside of the AFM electronics: 1. Input Voltage Terminal (from DME) 2. Ground 3. Temperature Sensor Output 4. Sensor Output Voltage (to DME) 5. Potentiometer Wiper Arm 6. Potentiometer Resistor Board 7. Potentiometer Conducting Strip Connect the 9 VDC battery negative lead to Terminal 4 on the AFM connector and the positive lead to Terminal 3.  Connect the voltmeter negative lead to the ground terminal (2) on the inside of the AFM and the positive lead to the sensor output voltage terminal (4). You should obtain a small voltage indication on the voltmeter. Using a new 9 volt battery which was reading 9.41 VDC prior to the test, I obtained slightly less than 0.5 VDC (.463 volts to be exact).  Slowly open the AFM barn door and observe the voltage. The voltage indication should increase steadily as the barn door is opened with no drops or large fluctuations in voltage. With the barn door full open the voltmeter should read slightly less than input voltage. In my case with the 9.41 VDC input voltage, I obtained an full open output voltage of 8.45 VDC. If any voltage drops or large fluctuations in voltage are noted, there are probably dead spots in the potentiometer conducting strip. This can sometimes be corrected by changing the position of the wiper arm. That will be discussed in the next section. AFM Cleaning and Repair Sometimes erratic operation of the AFM can be caused by dirty contacts, dirty conducting strip, or due to grooves worn in the AFM potentiometer conducting strip. This section covers cleaning the AFM and changing the position of the AFM wiper to correct erratic operation. With the AFM cover removed (see preceding sections), clean the AFM potentiometer conducting strip using a pencil eraser. Work carefully and don't be to aggressive when using the eraser. Clean the contacts on the bottom of the wiper arm (see picture below) using emery cloth or fine grit sandpaper (400 grit). The best way to do this is to disassemble the AFM enough to remove the wiper arm. If you don't feel comfortable disassembling the AFM, you can clean the wiper arm in place. However, you need to insert a sheet of paper between the wiper arm and the conducting strip first. Then clean the contacts by inserting the sandpaper or emery cloth between the paper and the contacts on the bottom side of the wiper arm. The paper serves to protect the conducting strip while cleaning the wiper arm contacts. Now that you've cleaned the AFM, it's a good idea to test it again to see if the cleaning has corrected the problem with erratic operation. If it does not correct the problem, and it's obvious that there are deep grooves in the potentiometer conducting strip, adjust the wiper arm position as described in the following step. Place a piece of paper between the wiper arm and the potentiometer conducting strip. Change the position of the wiper arm by pushing down on both sides of the back part of the wiper arm (see arrows in picture below) to bend the arm slightly. This effectively shortens the arm such that the contacts on the bottom side of the arm will ride on a different (ungrooved) part of the conducting strip. Test the AFM as described in previous sections to determine if erratic operation is corrected. If not, the AFM should be replaced.

Since testing the alarm module is difficult at best, bypassing the alarm system to see if the car will start is the next best thing. This requires disconnecting the alarm module and installing two jumpers in the electrical connector plug. Tools Two wire jumpers with spade connectors Procedure First, locate the alarm module. It's a black box approximately the size of a pack of cigarettes. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), it's located behind the radio in the back of the center console. On late model 944s, it's located behind the kick panel in the passenger's footwell near above the DME computer. Disconnect the electrical plug from the alarm module.

However, it is somewhat time consuming since a large number of parts have to be removed to actually get to the alternator. The cost of a new alternator is pretty steep. However, there are an increasing number of shops which do fine rebuilds on Bosch alternators. So, I recommend checking around in your area to see if there are any reputable rebuild shops before spending the money on a new alternator. If you can't keep you car off the road long enough to wait for a rebuild, purchasing a new or rebuilt alternator is really your only option. However, if your alternator supplier doesn't require a core, have your old alternator rebuilt anyway. At worst you'll have a spare alternator. You may even be able to sell your rebuilt alternator to another owner to recoup some of the money you spent on the new alternator. Tools Metric Socket Set Metric Wrenches Screwdriver Set Jack Stands and Floor Jack or Ramps Catch Pan Pry bar Other Procedures Needed COOL-02, Coolant System Draining, Filling, and Venting (Turbocharged Cars) Removal Disconnect the battery. It's a good idea to disconnect both terminals. However, it is imperative that you disconnect the positive lead as a minimum. Place the car on jack stands or ramps. While ramps are more convenient I find I have more room to work with the car on jack stands. Remove the skid pan from under the engine compartment (M6 bolts - 10 mm socket) Remove the Alternator/AC compressor belt as follows: The normal method of removing the alternator belt is to loosen the lock nuts on either end of the AC Compressor turnbuckle tensioner and rotating the turnbuckle until the tension is eased from the Alternator / AC Compressor belt. Then the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the alternator can be removed and the alternator rotated toward the engine to allow removal of the belt. The alternate method, which I prefer, is to loosen the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the compressor a few turns, then relieve the tension on the turnbuckle using the pry bar between the compressor and the block. While holding the pry bar in position, remove the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the compressor, rotate the compressor toward the engine, and remove the belt. The reason I prefer this method is that, assuming the belt was properly tensioned before removal, the belt can be reinstalled by reversing this procedure and little or no belt adjustment is required. If the car is equipped with power steering the Alternator / AC Compressor belt can not be completely removed without first removing the power steering belt. However, the belt does not have be completely removed unless it needs to be replaced. Loosen and remove the lower alternator retaining bolt at the back of the compressor. NOTE Some 944s have an air cooling supply via a flexible duct from the left front fender well to a black plastic shroud attached to the back of the alternator. These must be disconnected to remove the alternator from the car. If equipped, remove the flexible hose which goes from the front left fender to the black plastic shroud on the back of the alternator. This may be done using a stubby flat tip screwdriver or, if the clamp is oriented correctly by using a long thin blade flat tip screwdriver. Yes, it is important that this hose be reinstalled as it supplies cooling air to the alternator. Remove the air box and air flow meter from the vehicle. On turbocharged cars perform the following: Remove the intercooler outlet pipe to the intake manifold. Also, remove the rubber inlet plenum boot (to turbocharger). Drain as much coolant as possible from the coolant expansion tank using a hand vacuum pump or siphon pump. Disconnect the coolant hose from the coolant expansion tank to the crossover pipe and to the turbocharger cooling pump. Have some rags ready to catch the remaining coolant left in the hoses. Remove the remaining alternator retaining bolts. If equipped, lift the alternator sufficiently to remove the black plastic cover on the back of the alternator. Disconnect the wires from the back of the alternator and remove the alternator from the vehicle. Installation Place the new alternator into the vehicle. Ensure the rear alternator cover is in position before installing the alternator. Connect the wires to the alternator and attach the cover to the back of the alternator. Install the alternator retaining bolts. However, do not tighten yet. Install the alternator belt. If not already done, install the bottom nut for the rear alternator cover. Install the AC compressor turnbuckle to tension the AC Compressor / Alternator belt. Tighten the alternator retaining bolts. Install the cooling duct for the alternator. For turbocharged cars performed the following: Install the coolant hose from the coolant reservoir to the crossover pipe and turbo cooling pump. Install the rubber inlet plenum boot on the turbocharger suction. Install the intercooler discharge pipe to the intake manifold. Install the air flow meter and air box. On turbocharged cars, fill and vent the coolant system using COOL-02. Install the skid pan.

It will also provide instructions for resealing the balance shaft cover. At the back of the balance shaft housing there is also a large diameter plug which uses an o-ring to seal the rear of the housing. I don't normally recommend replacing this o-ring or resealing the balance shaft cover unless they actually start leaking. The reason being that removing the balance shaft covers can require significant disassembly of engine components, particularly on turbocharged cars. Also, on 1985½ and newer models, the is a seal between the upper balance shaft bearing cap and cover. This seal is used to direct oil flow from the upper balance shaft bearing to a fitting on the balance shaft cover which supplies the turbocharger on turbocharged cars. On normally aspirated cars the balance shaft cover is not tapped for a turbocharger oil supply fitting. However, the normally aspirated cars use the same bearing cap as the turbocharged cars. The seal must be installed to ensure adequate lubrication of the upper balance shaft bearing. If the balance shaft cover needs to be resealed or the rear sealing plug o-ring needs to be replaced, the bearing cap-to-cover seal must be replaced at the same time. This is not a concern on models through early 1985 as the bearing cap is machined integral to the balance shaft cover.

However, to replace the water pump, balance shaft seals, or front crankshaft oil seal, the crankshaft gear must be removed. Using ENG-05, remove the camshaft and balance shaft belts, all rollers, tensioners, balance shaft sprockets, crankshaft gears, and rear timing cover. Remove the woodruff key from the slot in the balance shaft. Remove the retaining bolts (3) that hold the front balance shaft support in place and slide the support off the end of the balance shaft. If the balance shaft cover needs to be resealed or the rear plug o-ring needs to be replaced, remove the balance shaft cover bolts and remove the cover and rear plug. Using a seal puller, remove the main seals from the front of the balance shaft support. If you don't have a seal puller, you can remove the seal by sliding a screwdriver under the inside lip of the seal and pry the seal out of the support. Remove the spacer from the balance shaft support. Using a small screwdriver or probe remove the large o-ring from the balance shaft support. Apply a thin coat of bearing grease to the o-ring groove in the balance shaft support, install the o-ring, and apply a thin coat of bearing grease to the outside of the o-ring. Apply a thin coat of bearing grease to the contact surfaces of the support spacer and install the spacer into the support housing. CAUTION While the main balance shaft seals appear identical, there is actually a 1 mm difference in the outside diameter of the seals. Don't confuse them or you will end up doing this job again. Apply a thin coat of bearing grease to the sealing surfaces of the main balance shaft seal and slide the seal into the front of the support. Tap the seal into place using a socket of slightly smaller outside diameter than the seal. If the balance shaft cover has been removed, perform the following: Install a new o-ring onto the rear housing plug and position the plug into the housing. Apply a thin coat of Loctite 574 (used to be Loctite 638) to the cover mating surface using a velour roller. Position the cover in place on the balance shaft housing. Install the balance shaft cover retaining bolts finger tight. Do not torque until front support is installed. Install the thin plastic seal onto the end of the balance shaft. Install the front support (with spacer and seal installed) onto the balance shaft and slide into the front of the housing until fully seated.

Install the water pump idler roller if removed. Tighten the idler roller retaining bolt to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Install crankshaft gear, if removed, ensuring that the lip on the timing gear is oriented toward the front of the car. Install the camshaft sprocket if removed. Install the cam belt tensioning roller if removed. NOTE On cars with spring tensioners, I prefer to install the spring tensioner as I'm routing the timing belt. In fact, I always remove the spring tensioner to install a new timing belt as it is much easier to route the belt. If flywheel lock was not used verify crankshaft at TDC on cylinder number 1 ( ENG-13). Align mark on camshaft sprocket with mark on rear distributor housing. Install timing belt as follows: Place belt on crankshaft gear. Route belt around camshaft sprocket. Insure that there is no slack in the belt between cam sprocket and crankshaft gear. Also, make sure that neither the crankshaft or the cam sprocket move from TDC during the belt installation. Finish by routing the belt around the water pump pulley and tensioning roller. Tension the camshaft belt using ENG-10. Balance Belt Installation If removed, install the balance belt sprockets using ENG-08. Using ENG-13, set the crankshaft to TDC for cylinder number 1. Install the balance belt gear on the crankshaft if removed. If the crankshaft bolt was removed, perform the following: Using ENG-03, Install the flywheel lock. Ensure the crankshaft timing gear, balance shaft belt gear, and alternator/AC compressor pulley are installed. Install the crankshaft bolt and torque to 210 Nm or 155 ft-lbs. If equipped, install the power steering pulley. Tension the pulley mounting bolts to 13 Nm (9.5 ft-lbs). Remove the flywheel lock. Align the upper balance shaft so that the notch on the edge of the sprocket aligns with the notch in the rear timing cover. It is located at approximately the 1 o'clock position. Align the lower balance shaft so that the notch on the edge of the sprocket aligns with the raised tab which is molded into the rear timing cover. It is located at approximately the 7 o'clock position. Install the balance belt as follows: Route the balance belt from the upper balance sprocket around the crankshaft gear. Ensure there is no slack in the belt from the upper sprocket to the crankshaft gear. Continue routing the belt around the lower balance sprocket again ensuring there is no slack from the crankshaft sprocket to the lower balance sprocket. Route the belt around the tensioning roller and back to the upper balance sprocket. Pre-tension the balance shaft belt enough to remove any slackness in the belt and tighten the tensioning roller locknut. NOTE Turn the tensioning roller clockwise to tighten, counter-clockwise to loosen. Install the balance shaft sprocket covers and retaining bolts. Tighten the retaining bolts to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs) while holding the sprocket with Special Tool 9200. Rotate crankshaft two complete turns and set at TDC for number 1 cylinder. Verify that the camshaft, balance shaft, and flywheel marks are aligned for TDC. NOTE It is not unusual for the balance shaft marks to be slightly out of alignment. Most often if they do not align, the lower shaft will be aligned with its mark and the upper shaft will be off approximately one-half tooth. If the shaft are out of alignment by a full tooth or more, they should be realigned. Tension the balance shaft belt using ENG-10. Install the front timing belt covers. Install alternator and power steering belts and retension. Install the air filter assembly ( AF-01). Reconnect battery.

Disconnect the battery positive lead. NOTE It is possible to remove the timing belt with out removing the balance shaft belt gear on the crankshaft. However, it is extremely difficult to install the new belt with the balance shaft gear in place. Rather than risk damaging the belt, I prefer to install the flywheel lock and remove the balance shaft gear. If you choose not to, the steps associated with installing the flywheel lock, removing the crankshaft pulley bolt, and removing the power steering and balance shaft gears may be deleted. Using ENG-03, install the flywheel lock. Remove the alternator and power steering pump belts. On Turbo models, remove the turbocharger outlet line to the intercooler (Large diameter aluminum tube to which the air filter assembly is clamped). Using AF-01, remove the air cleaner housing and air flow sensor assembly as a unit. Remove the front engine cover to access the timing and balance shaft belts (The cover is two pieces and is attached by 10mm head bolts). Remove the crankshaft pulley bolt using a 24mm or 15/16&quot; deep socket. Remove the power steering pulley. Remove the alternator/AC pulley and balance belt gear as a unit from the crankshaft. Loosen the balance shaft belt tensioner sprocket lock nut, then turn the tensioner nut counterclockwise to release the tension on the balance shaft belt. Loosen the balance belt idler idler roller lock nut, then rotate the idler to provide clearance for removal of the balance shaft belt. Remove the balance shaft belt and mark the direction of rotation on the belt if it is to be reused. If the balance shaft belt idler and balance shaft tensioning roller are to be inspected or need to be removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the locknuts and slide the rollers off the shafts. If the balance shaft sprockets need to be removed (i.e. water pump or oil seals), the sprockets will have to be locked in place to allow the retaining nuts to be loosened. Use the Balance Shaft Pin Spanner to hold the sprocket while loosening the retaining nut. You can also use two large punches and a set of locking pliers to hold the sprocket, but this is very awkward. After the retaining bolts have been removed, slide the balance shaft sprockets straight off the shaft. You may need to slide a small pry bar behind the sprocket to get it started. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap and the aluminum cover behind the distributor cap. This will reveal the main camshaft sprocket. If the timing belt is to be reused, mark the belt for direction of rotation before removing it. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. Hold the flats on the tensioner roller with an open end wrench while loosening the locknut to provide counter-torque. Failure to provide counter-torque while loosening (or tightening) the locknut causes stress on the tensioner roller stud which can lead to long-term failure. Remove the timing belt, being careful not to twist the belt if it is to be reused. It may be necessary to remove the balance belt gear on the crankshaft to allow removal of the timing belt. If the camshaft tensioning roller is to be inspected or removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the lock nut and slide the camshaft tensioning roller off the shaft. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can also be done using the factory balance shaft spanner if you have one. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. This will allow you to install the new belt without having to fight the spring tensioner. Remove the timing belt, being careful not to twist the belt if it is to be reused. If water pump or oil seal maintenance is being performed, the spring tensioner must be removed. Remove the entire spring tensioner assembly as a unit. The three bolts on the face plate of the spring tensioner are not used to remove the unit. There are three bolts (which are very difficult to see) at the back of the tensioner near the block which must be removed to get the assembly out. NOTE On spring tensioner cars, I find it very difficult to remove and install the timing belt with the spring tensioner assembly in place. I prefer to remove the spring tensioner assembly from the car during belt removal and reinstall while timing belt is being routed during installation. If the camshaft belt idler is to be inspected or removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the retaining bolt and the camshaft belt idler. If the crankshaft gear needs to be removed (i.e. water pump or oil seals), a gear puller is the easiest method. However, if a gear puller is not available, you can slide a pry bar behind the gear to get it started. If you use a pry bar, apply pressure gently so that you do not damage the rear timing belt cover (it's made of plastic). The back timing cover can now be removed by removing the 10mm bolts holding it in place. The back timing cover must be removed when replacing the water pump, front crankshaft oil seal, and the balance shaft oil seals.

This should be checked at the midpoint between the cam sprocket and the crankshaft sprocket. Tighten the tensioning roller locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Apply counter-torque to the tensioning roller eccentric nut while tightening locknut to prevent altering the belt tension. Note: Originally, this was the only method of tensioning used on 928s and 924s. I know of several shops that have never purchase Special Tool 9201 and use this method on 944s as well. However, it is very risky and I strongly recommend checking the belt with the factory tensioning gage. Belt Tensioning (1987 Model and Newer Cars With Spring Tensioner) Release the spring tensioner by loosening the locking nut and locking bolt near the spring end of the tensioner. Tighten the locking bolt and locknut to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Checking and Adjusting Cam Belt Tension (All Cars) Yes, all cars. While some people contend that the tension does not need to be checked on cars with spring tensioners, I would disagree. From experience, I've found that spring tensioners vary from car to car and will not apply the same tension consistently when the spring is released. The spring tensioners seem to get close enough to the 2.7 ±0.3 spec for a used belt to be of little concern. However, the spring tensioner WILL NOT tension a new belt to within the tolerance for a new belt (4.0 ±0.3) unless the spring is released, the engine is rolled a degree or two, and then the tensioner is tightened down. The problem is that since spring tensioners tend to vary, you don't know exactly how many degrees to roll the engine. That's why it's important to check the tension using Special Tool 9201. Procedure After the camshaft belt has been pre-tensioned, remove the flywheel lock if installed. NOTE Do not install starter until crankshaft bolt is installed and torqued as the flywheel lock will need to be installed again. Turn the engine clockwise two complete turns using the crankshaft pulley bolt (15/16&quot; or 24 mm) and align the mark on the camshaft sprocket with the alignment tab in the window on the distributor housing (TDC). Verify that the crankshaft is also at TDC by checking the &quot;OT&quot; mark in the window on the bell housing. Turn the crankshaft 10° counter-clockwise. This is approximately 1.5 teeth on the camshaft sprocket. Check the belt tension using Special Tool 9201. Pull the lock pin on the tool to release the tension roller. Align the drag needle with the gage needle. Install the tool on the long section of the cam belt between the cam sprocket and the cam belt idler roller. Make sure that the tool's tensioning roller is on the toothed side of the belt. NOTE When checking timing belt tension, the timing belt tool is installed such that the gauge on the tool is oriented upside down. It also requires the flat bars on the tool to slide between the timing belt and the timing belt cover which is a snug fit. This is perfectly acceptable. Push the tensioning roller against the cam belt until the locking pin on the tool engages. Read the tension on the dial. Tension specs: New belt - 4.0 ±0.3 Used belt - 2.7 ±0.3 Adjusting tension on cars with eccentric roller tensioners: Adjust the belt tension by loosening the tensioning roller locknut and turning the tensioning roller eccentric nut (thin 24 or thin 27 mm open end wrench) counter-clockwise and tighten locknut. Apply counter-torque to the eccentric roller when tightening locknut to prevent altering torque. Repeat the steps above until the cam belt tension is within the specified tolerance. Torque tensioner locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Adjusting tension on cars with spring tensioners: On the front plate of the spring tensioner there are three fasteners. One holds the roller in the tensioner. The other two are used to tension the belt. To tension the belt, simply loosen the lock nut on the pivot arm (top fastener) and the locking bolt (lower). You'll notice a slot behind the head on the lock bolt. Loosening the lock nut and bolt allows the tension to be released on the spring to retension the belt. Using a pry bar or balance shaft pin spanner, you may want to gently nudge the tensioner in release direction (i.e. more tension on the belt). Sometimes after sitting for a while the spring tensioners like to stick. Once you're satisfied that the tensioner has released, tighten the tensioner lock nut/bolt. Spring tensioners tend to be a bit unreliable as far as consistency in tensioning. I recommend checking the tension with the factory tool, the twist method (described previously in this procedure), or with an aftermarket tension tool (i.e. Optibelt, Market, etc.) NOTE The intended tool for this purpose is the balance shaft sprocket pin spanner (P9200). The spanner pins fit into two holes on the front of the spring tensioner body. Balance Shaft Belt Tensioning (All Cars) Determine the amount of belt tension required for the type of belt you have. Old style belt (15 mm wide) - 2.7 ± 0.3 New style belt (18 mm wide) - 3.5 ± 0.5 Loosen the locknut on the balance belt idler roller and move it away from the balance belt. It should not come in contact with the belt while checking the tension or during tension adjustment. Check the belt tension using Special Tool 9201. Pull the lock pin on the tool to release the tension roller. Align the drag needle with the gage needle. Install the tool on the section of the balance belt between the lower and upper balance shaft sprockets. Adjust and recheck the belt until the tension is within the specified limits. NOTE If you have someone to help you it is possible to adjust the belt tension while the tensioning gage is installed. However, the tension should be checked again after the tensioning roller locknut is torqued. When the belt is set at the proper tension, tighten the locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Apply counter-torque to the tensioning roller to prevent changing the belt tension. Adjust the balance belt idler roller such that the clearance between the roller and the belt at the lower balance shaft sprocket is 0.5 mm. This can be done with Special Tool 9207. I normally use a 0.5 mm feeler gauge. When properly adjusted, torque the locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs).

Large in-line four cylinder engines inherently produce large second order harmonic vibrations. To solve this problem, Porsche elected to use a balance shaft system on the 944. The balance shaft system was actually invented by Frederick Lanchester, an English inventor, in the early 1900's. However, it was Mitsubishi that eventually patented the idea which they called the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; system. Porsche developed their own balance shaft system for the 944 apparently using three bearings instead of the two employed by the Mitsubishi system. However, Porsche discovered that the Mitsubishi system worked better. So, Porsche paid Mitsubishi a royalty of 6 - 8 US dollars per car to use the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; system. Each balance shaft has two counterweights which resemble small hockey pucks with the shaft running through them. The two counterweights are about an 1-1/2 inches apart (or approximately 4 cm). The section of the shaft between the counterweights is machined for the main balance shaft bearing. The balance shaft turns the counterweights at twice the speed of the engine. With one located high on one side of the engine and the other low on the opposite side of the engine, the balance shafts turn in opposite directions from each other and balance the vibrations of the large spinning mass inside the engine. By the way, Frederick Lanchester in credited with a number of very significant inventions including disc brakes which he invented in 1903. Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[34]=new Array("shop-manual/eng-08.htm","Balance Shaft Sprocket Installation and Alignment Check","","ENG-08, Balance Shaft Sprocket Installation and Alignment Check Acrobat Printable Version Introduction If your 944 is experiencing vibration problems, the cause could be a balance shaft misalignment. This can occur if the balance shaft belt slips a tooth, the balance shaft belt is broken, or if the balance shaft sprockets are installed incorrectly. Quite often, balance shaft sprocket misalignment occurs after water pump, crankshaft oil seal, or balance shaft oil seal replacement. The following procedure will tell you how to correctly install the balance shaft sprockets and how to check them for proper alignment if you suspect that the sprockets may have been installed incorrectly. Other Procedures Needed ENG-13, Locating and Setting Engine to Top Dead Center (TDC), Cylinder 1 Installation Each balance shaft sprocket has two slotted grooves on the inside diameter. One of the grooves on the sprocket will slide onto a woodruff key which is inserted into a slot near the front end of the balance shaft. On 1983 and 1984 model 944s, each balance shaft sprocket was stamped on the front with an &quot;O&quot; (Ober or Over) beside one of the slotted grooves and a &quot;U&quot; (Unter or Under) beside the other slotted groove. As one might have guessed, on the upper balance shaft, the groove with the &quot;O&quot; stamped beside it was installed onto the woodruff key, and on the lower balance shaft, the groove with the &quot;U&quot; stamped beside it was installed onto the woodruff key. I'm not sure what prompted Porsche to do it but, on cars produced after 1984, only the slotted groove with the &quot;O&quot; was stamped. The groove which previously had the &quot;U&quot; stamped beside it, now has nothing. This is when problems started to occur with balance shaft misalignment. Mechanics who weren't previously familiar with 944s and who didn't pay close attention when they disassemble the balance shaft assemblies naturally assumed that on both shafts the &quot;O&quot; should go on the woodruff key. This causes the lower balance shaft to be 180 degrees out of alignment. The resulting vibration is actually worse than if there were no balance shafts at all. So, the important thing to remember is that on the later cars, the groove with the &quot;O&quot; goes on the woodruff key on the upper balance shaft and the groove with nothing stamped beside it goes on the woodruff key on the lower shaft. Checking Balance Shaft Alignment One of the most important parts of ensuring proper balance shaft alignment is ensuring the balance shaft sprockets are properly installed. Since we've already discussed proper installation, you should have no trouble installing them correctly. However, if everything is assembled, how do can you tell if the sprockets are correctly installed ? With the balance shaft sprocket covers installed, it is impossible to actually see the woodruff key to determine proper alignment. Each balance sprocket cover has a number of round openings and one rectangular opening. At the rectangular opening, there is a tab on the back of the cover which gets inserted into the groove that does not have the woodruff key. If the sprocket is properly installed on the upper balance shaft, the &quot;O&quot; stamped on the sprocket will be visible in one of the round openings on the cover. If the sprocket is properly installed on the lower balance shaft, the &quot;O&quot; stamped on the sprocket will be visible in the rectangular opening on the cover. NOTE The only problem with this method is that sometimes the tabs on the back of the sprocket covers get broken off. If this is the case, the only way to positively determine proper installation is to remove the sprocket retaining bolts, remove the cover plate, and slide a heavy piece of wire or a small probe into each groove to determine the location of the woodruff key. Once you're sure the sprockets are installed correctly, the balance shafts can be checked for proper alignment as follows: Using ENG-13, set the engine to TDC on cylinder #1. With the engine at TDC the notch on the back lip of the upper sprocket should align with the notch on the rear timing belt cover (approximately 1 o'clock position). For the lower balance shaft, the notch on the back lip of the sprocket should align with the raised tab on the inside of the back timing belt cover (approximately 7 o'clock position). Sometimes you'll find that the notches on the sprockets don't line up exactly. This is not uncommon. About half the 944s I've seen don't. However, with one sprocket dead on it's alignment mark, the other sprocket should be no more than about 1/2 tooth off. If it's out of alignment by 1 tooth or more then it should be realigned. Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[35]=new Array("shop-manual/elect-15.htm","Battery Checks","","ELECT-15, Battery Checks Acrobat Printable Version Introduction Performing a visual inspection of the battery is an important first step in determining the condition of the battery. If the visual checks don't reveal anything obviously wrong with the battery, proceed with the battery condition testing. Visual Checks Check the battery for cracks in the case. Check the battery terminals for corrosion. This will appear as white or rust colored material on the battery terminals / connectors. If corrosion is evident, loosen and disconnect the battery clamps. Clean the battery posts and clamps with a wire brush. After reconnecting the terminal leads, apply petroleum jelly to the post and clamps to minimize corrosion. You can also the felt rings for the battery posts to help reduce corrosion. On 944s, a battery cover is important to minimize corrosion and protect the battery tray. Check for bulges in the battery cases. This is indicative of a failing battery. Battery Condition Check The best way to check the condition of a battery is to take it to an auto parts store and have it professionally tested. However, you can check the state of charge of an automotive battery by checking the no load voltage of the battery. This must be done with a good quality digital multimeter with an accuracy of 0.5% or better. Disconnect the battery positive lead, check the battery terminal voltage, and compare to the table below. No Load Voltage (VDC) State of Charge 12.75 100% 12.45 75% 12.25 50% 12.05 25% 11.85 5% If ambient temperature is less than 21 °C (approximately 70 °F), then add 0.021 volts to the reading for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) below 21 °C (approximately 70 °F). Another way to check the condition of the battery is to check the specific gravity of each cell using a hydrometer. However, as most battery are now sealed units, this is normally not possible. Replace the battery if any of the following conditions exists: O VDC across a battery that's been charged 6-8 hours. This means there is and open cell in the battery. Approximately 10.0 - 10.6 VDC across a battery that's been charged for 6-8 hours. This means that there is a shorted cell in the battery. After being charged for 6-8 hours (at 13.8 to 14.6 VDC) the battery will not hold a charge of at least 12.45 VDC. Additional Information Another way to tell if the battery has sufficient charge to roll the engine is to take a look at the interior lights. If the interior lights are extremely dim or won't light at all, there is not enough charge in the battery to roll the engine. Charging a 944 Battery The best method to charge a battery is to charge slowly using an automatic constant voltage charger. You should charge the battery for 6 - 8 hours at 13.8 to 14.6 VDC. Charging at less than 13.8 VDC or greater than 14.6 VDC can shorten the life of a battery significantly. Jump Starting a 944 Connecting jumper leads or battery charger leads to a 944 poses an interesting problem. The battery positive terminal is located in close proximity to the windshield frame. Consequently, it's difficult to connect a jumper or battery charger lead clamp to the terminal without touching the windshield frame (DC arc welding lesson 101). I avoid this by clamping onto the battery positive terminal with a pair of needle-nose vise grips and then attach the charger or jumper lead to the vise grips. I recommend connecting jumper or battery charger leads in the following order: Dead battery positive Good battery positive Dead battery negative (preferably a ground away from the battery) Good battery negative (again preferably a ground away from the battery) IMPORTANT! When jump starting a 944 using a battery charger, never, ever use the battery charger's BOOST feature (if equipped). It will burn up the DME computer.");sQ1[36]=new Array("shop-manual/body-06.htm","Battery Tray Repairs","","BODY-06, Battery Tray Leaks/Repairs Acrobat Printable Version Introduction A leaking battery tray can be catastrophic. Particularly if you own a 944 which has it's DME located in the passenger's footwell. When the battery tray leaks, water drips onto the DME wiring harness and runs into the DME control unit case. On turbocharged cars, the KLR unit can be affected as well. Leaking battery trays normally occur when the battery tray drain clogs and water stands in the battery tray for long periods of time. It can also occur if the battery cover is missing. Water running off the windshield (from rain or when you wash your car) runs on top of the unprotected battery and washes acid from the outside of the battery to the bottom of the battery tray. It is therefore important that the battery be removed periodically, the tray cleaned thoroughly, and the drain checked to ensure it is draining properly. Procedure There are several different methods which may be used to repair a leaking battery. I will describe two of the methods here. The method chosen depends on the extent of the damage to the battery tray. The method required may also determine whether the projects are within the capability of the shade tree mechanic as well. Determining Which Repair Method to Use If there are no visible holes in the bottom of the battery tray or the holes a very small in size &quot;Method 1&quot; may be used. However, if the battery tray has large holes or there is a general weakening of the battery tray bottom (flexes easily when pushed on) &quot;Method 2&quot; should be used. Method 1 As already stated, Method 1 should only be used if the damage to the battery tray is relatively minor. For 944s whose DME control unit is located in the passenger footwell, or in the case of 944 Turbos, the DME and KLR control units, the control units should be removed before attempting any repairs to prevent damage to the control units. First, check the battery tray drain to see if it is clogged and clean it out if necessary. You can check the drain by pouring a cup of water into the tray and see if it drains readily. Since you know your tray is leaking, you should stuff some rags around the underside of the tray to absorb any leakage. Then, the entire battery tray should be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution and rinsed thoroughly. This includes removing any debris that's too large to be flushed out the drain (i.e. leaves, etc.). Next, scrape the bottom of the battery tray with a metal scraper to remove any loose paint. If there is any discoloration of the paint (i.e. rust color) or any rusted metal is exposed, the tray must be treated with a rust converter. This will convert the rusted metal back to a form that can be painted. On light colored cars discoloration of the paint in the battery tray is very easy to identify. However, with medium and dark colored paint, it is difficult, and sometimes almost impossible to identify all areas where there may be rust forming under the existing paint. For dark colored cars, I recommend removing as much of the paint from the bottom of the battery tray as possible. Then, treat rusted areas with rust converter as required. There are several different versions of rust converter. Mar-Hyde makes a very good converter which is applied with a brush. I've used the Mar-Hyde brand with results on my own car. I obtained it at a local auto paint supply dealer. I've also used a rust converter which comes in a spray can which I bought at Wal-Mart (sorry can't remember the brand). Be sure you wear gloves, mask, and eye protection when working with the rust converter. You DON'T want to get any on your skin. I'm told it will discolor your skins and takes an extremely long time to wear off. After the rust converter is completely dry, coat the entire bottom of the battery tray with a &quot;brushable seam sealer&quot; (that's the stuff with brush lines in it that you see all over the engine compartment in a 944). For bare metal, it is desirable to prime the surface before applying the seam sealer. 3M makes a good brushable seam sealer that's available at most auto paint supply stores. If you're worried about aesthetics try to make your brush strokes similar to other areas under the hood where brushable seam sealer has been applied at the factory. After the seam sealer is dry the battery tray may be painted to match the rest of the car's paint. Normally, the seam sealer does not need to be primed prior to painting. After the battery tray is repaired, ensure that the battery has a battery cover installed. This with help prevent acid from being flushed off of the battery terminals during rainy weather or when the car is being washed. Also, make sure you remove the battery periodically and clean the tray. Make sure the battery tray drain is clear during cleaning. Method 2 Method 2 should be used if there is significant damage to the battery tray. I won't describe this method in great detail because it is beyond the capability of most shade tree mechanics. In this method, the bottom of the battery tray has been damage to the point that it is not repairable. So, the bottom of the tray must be removed and a new tray bottom installed. First, determine how much of the battery tray bottom must be removed and mark the area with a permanent marker, paint, scratch awl, etc. Remove the affected area using a cutoff tool, cutting torch, or if you have access to one (I hate you) plasma cutter. Next, make a template for the replacement bottom by having someone hold a sheet of paper against the bottom of the tray and tracing the cutout area onto the paper. Use the template to transfer the drawing of the replacement bottom to the metal plate you intend to use for the bottom. You may choose to use carbon, galvanized, or stainless steel. I prefer galvanized or stainless for obvious reasons but, it depends on what type of welding equipment you have available. Cutout the new bottom and tack weld in to place in the tray to keep it from moving while you complete the welding. Use a hand grinder to clean up the welds on the tray side of the bottom (the underside isn't as critical). Coat the entire bottom of the battery tray with a &quot;brushable seam sealer&quot; (that's the stuff with brush lines in it that you see all over the engine compartment in a 944). For bare metal, it is desirable to prime the surface before applying the seam sealer. 3M makes a good brushable seam sealer that's available at most auto paint supply stores. If you're worried about aesthetics try to make your brush strokes similar to other areas under the hood where brushable seam sealer has been applied at the factory.

That means that the dimensions of the battery are 11- 3/16&quot; L x 6 - 7/8&quot; W x 6 - 7/8&quot; H. For a full list of BCI Battery sizes click here. Most 944 batteries now days are rated for 50 to 70 amp-hours (AH). That's means if you have a 50 AH battery, it should be able to discharge 1 A for 50 hours without falling below 10.5 VDC terminal voltage. That's considered about the minimum cranking voltage for a battery. The normal battery discharge rate for a 924, 944, or 968 with the ignition turned off and the key removed from the ignition should be less than 60mA. If you current draw is more than 65 mA, you should start looking for a problem. So, working the math, if you have a 50 AH battery and your battery discharge rate is 60 mA, the battery should last for about 30 days and still be able to crank the car. Realize that this will change as the battery gets older and it will also be different under varying weather conditions to which the car (and battery) may be subjected. Checking Battery Discharge Rate and Identifying Causes of High Battery Discharge Rate Disconnect the battery positive lead. Connect the digital multimeter between the battery positive lead and the battery positive terminal. Select the multimeter to the ammeter function and turn the meter ON. Check the multimeter reading less than 65 mA (.065 A). That's your discharge rate. If the discharge rate is greater than 65 mA, start removing and then reinstalling fuses one at a time. When you remove each fuse, write down how much the discharge rate of the battery decreases. After that, try removing and installing relays one at a time and write down how much the discharge rate drops for each relay. Once you've completed this, identify all of the locations where you saw a significant decrease discharge rate. Using the factory wiring diagrams if necessary, determine all components supplied by those fuse/relay locations. Disconnect components from those circuits one at a time until you identify which one is the cause of the high current draw (as indicated by the ammeter).

Since most of the 944 engine is aluminum the steel bolt thread tend to bond to the aluminum. Because of this, almost everyone who has ever worked on a 944 engine has stripped an Allen head or cheesehead bolt at some time. To help prevent this, I'll share this tip I learned from a mechanic friend of mine. &quot;Waking Up&quot; the Bolts Using a punch or socket extension and a hammer, tap around the outside head of the bolt. For Allen head bolts, tapping on the inside of the Allen head opening with a punch and hammer is effective as well. While attempting to remove the bolt, ensure that the Allen head tool or cheesehead socket remains inserted straight into the head of the bolt. This requires using two hands, one to hold the tool straight into the head and the other to turn the tool. If the bolt does not break free easily, tap the head again.

Since 1984, all 944 models and the 968 are equipped with wear indicators. When the brake pads are worn to the point that the wear indicators make contact with the rotor, a light will be illuminated on the dash to indicate that the pads need to be replaced. However, the wear indicators can become damaged and should not be considered 100% reliable for indicating when the brake pads should be replaced. The Brake System should be checked every 15,000 miles as a minimum. However, you should also check the brakes any time you have the wheels removed for other maintenance. Tools Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Jack Stands Floor Jack Front and Rear Disc Brake Inspection Place the vehicle on jack stands. Remove the wheels. Looking from the side of the brake caliper you can see the brake pad and rotor in the opening in the caliper. Measure the distance between the metal backing plate on the brake pad to the surface of the rotor. This is the brake lining thickness. If the brake lining thickness is 5/64&quot; (2 mm), replace the brake pads. However, due to differences in brake lining rivet thickness Porsche generally recommends replacing pads if the linings are less than 2.5 mm (3/32&quot;). If you have difficulty measuring the brake lining thickness, remove the brake pad and measure the thickness of the lining. ' Also, inspect the brake calipers, hoses, and fittings for signs of leakage or cracking and repair/replace as necessary. Parking Brake Inspection Park the vehicle on a steep hill with the transmission in neutral. If the parking brake will not hold the vehicle stationary with the transmission in neutral, adjust the parking brake using BRAKE-05. If the parking brakes will still not hold after adjustment, remove the rear rotors and inspect/replace parking brake pads as necessary.

When the brake pads are worn to the point that the wear indicators make contact with the rotor, a light will be illuminated on the dash to indicate that the pads need to be replaced. However, the wear indicators can become damaged and should not be considered 100% reliable for indicating when the brake pads should be replaced. The wheels must be removed to check the brake pads. The brakes should be inspected each time the tires are rotated. For models with tires that can not be rotated (i.e. different sizes tires front and rear), the brakes should be inspected every 15,000 miles as a minimum. Any time the wheels are removed, it's a good idea to inspect the brakes. The minimum allowed thickness for the brakes pads is 2 mm. However, Porsche generally recommends replacing the brake pads at a thickness of 2.5 mm. If the brake pads are replaced at 2mm or the wear indicators have been activated, the wear indicators must be replaced along with the brake pads. Replacing the Brake Pads Tools Needed Jack Stands 19 mm socket and ratchet/breaker bar (preferably 1/2&quot; drive) Metric wrench set Metric socket set Bailing wire / shock cords Bearing grease / Petroleum jelly or anti-squeal pads Hammer and Flat tip punch (Normally aspirated 944s and 924s only) Large channel lock pliers Needle nose pliers Lineman's pliers Turkey baster or vacuum pump type brake bleeder (for removing brake fluid if reservoir level is too high) Rags for cleaning brakes Small pry bar or large flat tip screwdriver Brake piston compressor (optional) Procedure Using the 19 mm socket and ratchet or breaker bar, loosen the lug nuts (two turns only) on the wheels where brake pads are going to be replaced. Place the car on jack stands. Remove the wheels for the brake pads to be replaced. Remove the old brake pads. On 944 / 944S cars perform the following: Remove the cotter pins from the brake pad retaining pins. Remove the spring lock (also referred to as the anti-rattle spring) from the brake pad retaining pins. Using a hammer and flat tip punch, drive the retaining pins out of the brake pads / calipers. If equipped, remove the wear pad indicators (wire coming off one of the brake pads). Be careful removing the wear indicators as the clips break easily. NOTE As the brake caliper is pressed outward, brake fluid is being force back into the brake reservoir. Keep a close eye on brake fluid reservoir level while pressing out caliper to prevent overflowing the reservoir. If level gets too high, remove some of the fluid from the reservoir using a turkey baster or a vacuum pump brake bleeder. Using a large flat tip screwdriver or small pry bar, press the movable part of the brake caliper outward. Do not press against the rotor if possible. Pressing against the brake pad is okay since it's going to get replaced anyway. Using needle nose or lineman's pliers, remove the inner and outer brake pads. On 944 S2 / 944 Turbo / 968 cars perform the following: Using channel lock pliers, compress the spring clip in the middle and disengage from the support by pushing the spring clip inward toward the brake rotor. Move the clip support away from the top of the clip and pivot the clip out away from the caliper. Remove the wear pad indicator by lifting the wire lead from the groove in the brake caliper and disengaging the wear pad from the brake pad plate. NOTE As the brake caliper piston is pressed outward, brake fluid is being force back into the brake reservoir. Keep a close eye on brake fluid reservoir level while pressing out caliper piston to prevent overflowing the reservoir. If level gets too high, remove some of the fluid from the reservoir using a turkey baster or a vacuum pump brake bleeder. At this point, I normally insert a small pry bar between the brake pad vibration backing plate (if equipped) and the back of the brake pad to press the caliper piston fully out (flush with the surface of the caliper). This may be difficult as the vibration dampers are attached to the brake pad plate by an adhesive backing. Prying between the vibration damper and the pad prevents damaging the caliper piston seals. Leaving the old pad in place will normally allow you enough leverage to move the caliper piston(s) fully out. Moving the piston fully out prior to removing the old pad ensures you have enough room to install the new pads. If the old pads do not have vibration backing plates, pry between the brake pad and the lip of the rotor (taking care not to damage the rotor) enough to loosen the pads and then insert a thin piece of sheet metal between the pad and the caliper pistons. The pry between the sheet metal and the brake pad to move the caliper pistons as previously described. Using lineman's pliers or needle nose pliers remove the old brake pads. Using clean rags and brake cleaner clean the calipers and rotors prior to installing new brake pads. Many of the replacement brake pads are now provided with vibration damper backing plates. If they are provided, I recommend using them on any 944. However, when asbestos-free pads are used on models with fixed calipers (i.e. one piece calipers), the vibration dampers MUST be used. If vibrations dampers are not provided, double-sided adhesive tape may be used instead. Porsche recommends using Scotch-3M No. 9485 (38 mm wide). Install the new brake pads into the calipers. On 944 / 944S cars perform the following: Insert the brake pad retain pins. Using a hammer and flat tip punch, drive the pins into the fully engaged position. Install the locking spring and cotter pins onto the brake pad retaining pins. A flat tip screwdriver may be needed to compress the locking spring during installation. On 944 S2 / 944 Turbo / 968 cars perform the following: Pivot the spring lock toward the rotor. Using a pair of channel lock pliers, compress the spring lock in the middle and push into position against the rotor. While pushing against the spring lock with the pliers, move the spring clip support into position at the top of the clip. Repeat the above steps until all the brake pads that need replacing have been replaced. Install the wheels and lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts to 130 Nm (96 ft-lbs). Remove car from jack stands. Ensure parking brake is engaged. You may also wish to install wheel chocks. Check brake fluid reservoir level and fill if necessary. Start vehicle and pump brakes until the brake pedal has a solid feel at it's normal pedal height. Do not move vehicle until this is done. Check brake fluid reservoir level again after pumping brakes. If brakes feel spongy after pumping, bleed the brakes using BRAKE-01. Take the car for a drive (few miles) making a few stops along the way. Make easy stops at first and then progressively harder, quicker stops. The will help ensure the brake pads are seated properly. An acrid, burning smell and some smoke from the brakes is normal until they are properly seated.

This means that it will readily absorb moisture. In fact, it will absorb moisture out of the air. Moisture in your brake fluid does two things. When the brake fluid becomes hot under hard braking, the water in the brake fluid boils. This causes steam voids in the brake system which causes a dramatic reduction in braking capability. In severe cases it can cause braking capability to be lost completely. Moisture in the brake system also causes internal corrosion of brake system components resulting in loss of braking capability. Therefore, it is extremely important to change your brake fluid at the specified intervals. Your brake fluid should be changed at least once per year and more frequently if the car is tracked. In fact, some PCA regions require that your brake fluid be changed within three months of a driving event. Make sure you use a good DOT 4 brake fluid. DO NOT use DOT 3 or DOT 5 fluid. For cars that are frequently tracked, you should use a brake fluid with a higher boiling temperature. ATE Super Blue is one of the more commonly used high temperature brake fluids. Tools Jack stands or ramps Container to catch fluid during bleeding Turkey baster or hand vacuum pump type brake bleeder ( vacuum pump bleeder required for one person brake bleeding) Wrench Catch Rags Brake fluid (1 liter or 1 quart for complete change) Procedure Place the vehicle on jack stands or ramps. Remove the brake fluid reservoir cover. Using a turkey baster or hand vacuum pump type brake bleeder, remove as much of the brake fluid from the reservoir as possible. Using clean rags, wipe out the brake fluid reservoir ensuring that no trash or debris gets into the reservoir. Refill the reservoir with new brake fluid (DOT 4). NOTE When bleeding brakes, always start with the caliper farthest away from the master cylinder and work toward the master cylinder. In other words: Right rear Left rear Right front Left front If two people are available perform the following: Position a catch pan and rags at the caliper to be bled first. Determine the correct size wrench for the bleeder and remove the rubber boot cover from the bleeder. Position the other person in the driver's seat. Have the person in the driver's seat pump the brakes several times and then hold the pedal in the depressed position. NOTE Once the bleeder is opened the person holding the brake will feel the pedal go to the floor. This is perfectly normal and they should NOT remove their foot from the pedal until directed to do so by the person doing the bleeding. If they release the brake while the bleeder is open, air will be drawn into the brake system making it more difficult to vent. Open the bleeder and catch the brake fluid that comes out in the container. When fluid stops coming out, close the bleeder. The person in the car may now release the brake pedal. Repeat the steps above until clean brake fluid comes out of the bleeder. Wipe up any spilled brake fluid with the catch rags. NOTE On 944 Turbos, 944 S2, and 968s there are two bleeders on each caliper. Bleeding should be done separately through each bleeder on the caliper. Repeat this process until all four brakes are done. For cars equipped with hydraulic clutches, the clutch should be bled at the slave cylinder as well. If bleeding is to be done by one person with a hand vacuum pump type bleeder, perform the following: Position the vacuum pump, appropriate size wrench for the bleeder screw, and catch rags at the caliper and remove the rubber boot from the brake bleeder. Connect the vacuum pump to the tip of the brake bleeder (Figure 1). Most vacuum pump kits now come with a variety of adapters. Find an adapter that will provide a tight seal on the brake bleeder. Pump the vacuum pump about 10 times and open the brake bleeder. As fluid comes out of bleeder into the container, continue to pump the vacuum pump until clean brake fluid starts to come out of the bleeder. If the container fills prior to getting clean fluid, stop bleeding by closing the bleeder. Empty the vacuum pump container and start bleeding again. When clean fluid comes out of the bleeder, close the bleed screw. Wipe up any spilled brake fluid with the catch rags. NOTE On 944 Turbos, 944 S2, and 968s there are two bleeders on each caliper. Bleeding should be done separately through each bleeder on the caliper. Repeat this process until all four brakes are done. For cars equipped with hydraulic clutches, the clutch should be bled at the slave cylinder as well.

You may actually have a master cylinder and brake booster from different manufacturers. Girling master cylinders are stamped with a &quot;G&quot; while Teves master cylinders are stamped with &quot;Ate&quot;. Also the stops screws are in different locations. On the Teves, the stop screw is on top of the master cylinder between the ports for the reservoir tank. On the Girling, the stop screw is on the side. If you are merely replacing the master cylinder, it doesn't really matter which master cylinder you have or which one you get as a replacement. It really only matters if you decide the rebuild the unit yourself in which case the rebuild kits will be different. Before deciding on whether to rebuild or replace, first check the prices on a new or rebuilt unit as compared to a rebuild kit. If the replacement unit is not significantly more expensive than the rebuild kit, it may be worth you while to simply replace since the replacement unit will probably come with at least a one year and possibly a two year warranty (two year warranty if it comes from Porsche). Removal Place catch rags underneath the brake master cylinder. Attempt to keep brake fluid from coming in contact with painted surface. While not absolutely necessary, I normally drain as much fluid from the brake reservoir as possible before beginning as it minimizes the mess and cleanup afterwards. I normally use a hand vacuum pump to drain the reservoir. After you drain the reservoir (if you chose to do so), remove the reservoir by pulling straight up on it. It may be necessary to rock it back and forth slightly to free it from the rubber grommets which mount the reservoir to the master cylinder. Be sure to catch any residual brake fluid which escapes from the reservoir using the catch rags. Place the reservoir over to the side on the fender well (leaving the slave cylinder line and level sensor wires attached) .Place rags underneath to catch any remaining fluid Remove the two retaining nuts that hold the master cylinder to the brake booster and remove the master cylinder from the car. Installation Most master cylinders will come with instructions for filling the unit prior to installation. This usually involves installing the reservoir tank onto the master cylinder and installing nipples into the brake line ports with clear tubing routed back to the reservoir. Fill the reservoir with fresh brake fluid. Press on the master cylinder piston to force fluid through the clear plastic lines. Continue to do this until no more bubbles appear in the lines. Attach the master cylinder to the brake booster using the two retaining nuts. Attach the brake lines to the master cylinder. Bleed the brakes and clutch.

Check front brake rotor run out as follows: Adjust front wheel bearing play using SUSP-08. Remove the front brake pads using BRAKE-02. Attach a dial indicator to the brake caliper. Set the dial indicator to zero and place the indicator pointer near the center of the brake rotor. Turn the rotor by hand and check the run out. Lateral run out should not exceed 0.1 mm. Check rear brake rotor run out as follows: Remove the rear brake pads. Attach a dial indicator to the brake caliper. Set the dial indicator to zero and place the indicator pointer near the center of the brake rotor. Turn the rotor by hand and check the run out. Lateral run out should not exceed 0.1 mm. If the rotor run out exceeds 0.1 mm, check the wheel hub run out. Rotor run out should not exceed 0.05 mm. For '87 model year and newer cars, the front brake rotor must be removed to check the wheel hub run out. On all cars, the rear brake rotor must be removed to check the hub run out. If the run out exceeds 0.05 mm, the hub should be replaced. If the hub run out is within limits, the brake rotor run out may be reduced by installing thin shims on the wheel studs or brake rotor mounting bolts between the hub and the rotor. It may also be reduced to within limits by having a machine shop resurface the rotor. If the lateral run out can not be reduced to within limits, the rotor should be replaced. Removing the Brake Rotors For 944s through the 1986 model year, remove the front brake rotor as follows: Remove the brake pads using BRAKE-02. Remove the two caliper retaining bolts that attach the caliper to the steering knuckle, slide the caliper off the rotor, and hang the caliper out of the way with shock cord or wire. Remove the dust cap on the front wheel. Loosen the Allen bolt on the clamping nut. Remove the clamping nut and slide the hub and rotor off the front spindle. The outer wheel bearing will likely fall out of the hub as you remove it from the spindle. If the rotor is to be reused, mark the orientation of the rotor to the hub. Separate the rotor from the hub by removing the rotor retaining bolts. For model year 1987 and newer cars (944, 944 S, 944 S2, and 944 Turbo), remove the front brake rotor as follows: Remove the brake pads using BRAKE-02. Remove the retaining bolts that attach the caliper to the to the steering knuckle, slide the caliper off the rotor, and hang the caliper out of the way with shock cord or wire. If the brake rotor is to be reused, mark the orientation of the rotor to the hub. Remove the countersunk screws that attach the brake rotor to the hub. Remove the rotor by sliding the rotor straight off the hub. Remove the rear brake rotor as follows: If equipped with steel trailing arms (as opposed to aluminum), remove the rear wheel spacer. If the brake rotor is to be reused, mark the orientation of the rotor to the hub. Remove the countersunk screw that holds the rotor to the hub. Attempt to remove the rotor by pulling it straight off the hub. If the hub will not come off, insert a flat tip screwdriver through the access hole in the rotor and adjust the parking brake to allow the rotor to be removed. If the rotor will still not come off, thread two bolts into the holes provided in the rotor. Alternately turn the bolts several turns to jack the rotor off the hub. Installing Brake Rotors For 944s through the 1986 model year, install the front brake rotors as follows: Attach the brake rotor to the hub using the five retaining bolts. Ensure th inner wheel bearing is installed in the hub. Install a new wheel bearing seal in the hub. Slide the hub/rotor assembly onto the front spindle. You will feel some resistance as the seal presses on to the spindle. Check the grease packing on the outer wheel bearing, slide the outer bearing onto the spindle, and seat the bearing into the hub. Adjust the front bearing play using SUSP-08. Slide the caliper on to the rotor and attach the caliper to the steering knuckle using the retaining bolts. Install the brake pads using BRAKE-02.

This bar mounts to the rear seat shoulder belt mounting points. I did this hastily so, the details will be a little sketchy. I will come back and add more detailed instructions at a later date. I ended up using reinforcement plates in several locations on the aluminum channel as it bends very easily when the fasteners are torqued down. Realize that these instructions may need to be modified based on the type of camera you have. So, study the instructions before you start and take some measurements of your own video camera to ensure that they will work. Tools Hack Saw Drill and Drill Bits Materials 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel 49-1/4&quot; long 2 pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide x 4-1/2&quot; long 1 piece of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide 6&quot; long 2 pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide by 1&quot; long 5 - 1/4&quot; bolts x 1-3/4&quot; long (standard thread) 4 - 1/4&quot; nuts 2 - 7/16&quot; fine thread bolts (don't know the exact pitch) 1 - 1/4&quot; C-clip Rubber padding to go between camera and camera bar. Construction Take a piece of 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel and cut it to 49-1/4&quot;. Cut two pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate to 1-1/4&quot; wide x 4-1/2&quot; long. These will be for the bracket mounting bars. From the two pieces of steel cut above, make the bar mounting brackets as follows: Make a 90° bend approximately 1&quot; from the end of the plate. The camera bar will rest on these part of the plate. Approximately 1-3/4&quot; from the inside of the 90° bend made in the step above, make a 35° bend in the same direction as the 90° bend (see picture below). Drill a 1/2&quot; hole in the part of the bar that was bent to the 35° angle. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole in the part of the bar that was bent to the 90° angle. Cut two pieces of 1/8&quot; galvanized plate 1-1/4&quot; wide x 1&quot; long. These will be used for a reinforcement plate where the brackets are bolted to the 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole in the center of the reinforcing plate. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole through each end of the aluminum channel. Before you drill, mark the hole location using the 3/8&quot; hole you drilled in the end bracket you constructed to determine the exact location of the hole. Attach the bracket and reinforcing plates to each end of the aluminum channel using a 1/4&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; bolt and nut. Fabricate a 1-1/4&quot; x 6&quot; reinforcing plate from 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate. Drill 3/8&quot; mounting holes through the reinforcing plate and aluminum channel so that the plate will be centered on the camera bar. Attach the reinforcing plate to the bar top of the camera bar using two 1/4&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; bolts and nuts. For mounting the camera, most camera mounts use a standard 1/4&quot; standard thread. However, you may need a different mounting bolt depending on your camera. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole for the camera mounting bolt through the center of the reinforcing plate and aluminum channel. Insert a 1/4&quot; bolt x 1-3/4&quot; bolt from the bottom side of the camera bar and check the amount of penetration through the top side of the bar. If the bolt penetrates too far through the bar, you won't be able to tighten it enough to get the camera to sit flush with the bar. I ended up using two flat washers between the bolt and the bottom of the bar to provide enough spacing. The mounting bolts for the bar are a bit difficult to locate. The bar mounts to the rear seat shoulder belt mounting points. If your car is equipped with rear shoulder belts (early cars are not, later cars are), you can simply use the shoulder harness mounting bolts. If the car is not equipped with shoulder harnesses, the mounting points with have plasitc plug inerts. These can NOT be used to mount the bar as they are not strong enough. Personally, I had trouble locating the correct size bolt to fit the mounting point. It appears that it is approximately an 11 mm bolt with a fine thread. I ended up using a 7/16&quot; fine thread bolt approximately 1&quot; long which worked well. The next part isn't critical but, it's a nice feature which you may want to take the time to add. I wanted to leave the camera mounting bolt in the bar all the time. So, I cut a channel around the part of the bolt where it penetrates the top of the bar and installed a C-clip to hold it in the bar. However, if you do this, you'll also have to install some rubber padding on the reinforcing bar to provide spacing for the C-clip so the camera will sit flush. Another feature I added was a security strap for the camera. I simply added another plate on the bottom side of one of the reinforcing plate bolts for the strap to attach to. In most track events, the governing sponsor of the event normally requires a safety strap for the camera.

If a scraper is used to remove the old gasket material, do so carefully to prevent gouging or scratching the mating surfaces. Minor scratches in the mating surface may be removed with emery cloth or fine grit sandpaper. Ensure that the rear distributor housing and cam sprocket are installed. Set the alignment mark on the cam sprocket to the alignment mark on the rear distributor housing (i.e. TDC). If old lifters are to be reused, ensure that all lifters are installed in the same location their were in on removal. If new lifters are being installed, be sure to soak them in oil for several hours prior to installation. After soaking them for a period of time, compressing them between the fingers along with additional period of oil soak will minimize the time for the lifters to properly &quot;self-adjust&quot; after initial startup. NOTE A coat of grease on the outside of the outside of the lifters will help hold the lifters in the cam housing during installation. Place a new cam housing gasket onto the cylinder head mating surface. If correctly oriented the letters &quot;OBEN&quot; or &quot;TOP&quot; will be facing up. Correct orientation is important as the oil supply passage to the cam housing (lifters and cam bearings) can otherwise be blocked. Ensure the engine is aligned to TDC ( ENG-13). Place the cam housing onto the cylinder head and ensure that it engages the alignment pins on the head. The cam housing will not sit flush with the cylinder head as some of the cam lobes will be positioned to try and open their respective valves. NOTE As the cam housing bolts are tightened, the cam may move slightly from the TDC alignment mark. This is expected. Install the cam housing bolts (M8). A small amount of grease in the head of the Allen bolt or on the tip of the Allen head socket will hold the bolt on the socket while installing inside the cam housing. Remember to install the coolant return pipe when installing the cam housing bolts. There is no specified tightening sequence for the cam housing bolts. However, they should be tightened so that the cam housing is pulled down evenly onto the alignment pins. Once the housing is fully seated on the head, torque the cam housing bolts to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs). Install and tension the camshaft belt using applicable portions of ENG-06 and ENG-10. Install the front timing covers. Using FUEL-02, install the fuel rail and injectors. Using IGN-01, install the distributor cap and rotor. If equipped, reconnect the cruise control cable to the cruise control servo. Connect the battery leads.

For 1987 - on models with spring tensioners. Disconnect the battery negative lead. Using AF-01, remove the air filter housing and air flow sensor. Remove the alternator and power steering belts. Remove the front timing covers. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap and rotor. Remove the front distributor housing cover. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. Hold the flats on the tensioner roller with an open end wrench while loosening the locknut to provide counter-torque. Failure to provide counter-torque while loosening (or tightening) the locknut causes stress on the tensioner roller stud which can lead to long-term failure. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can also be done using the factory balance shaft spanner if you have one. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. With the timing belt detensioned, slide the timing belt off the camshaft sprocket. Figure 1. Figure 2. NOTE Use the cam housing exploded drawing above and the component reference numbers in the preceding steps to determine the location of various components. The camshaft sprocket is held in place by a retaining collar (Figure 1, 18). Mounted in a recess in the end of the retaining collar, there is a connector to which the ignition rotor is mounted (Figure 2, 26). After removing the rotor and the front distributor housing, remove the bolt (10 mm socket or wrench) which holds the connector in the collar and remove the connector by pulling straight out of the collar. It can be difficult to remove and may require heating the outside of the recess in the camshaft to loosen. Behind the connector, you will find an M10 x 65 mm bolt in a recess in the retaining collar (Figure 1, 19). This bolt holds the retaining collar and camshaft sprocket to the end of the camshaft. On some cars this may be a hex (Allen) head bolt or a cheesehead (12 point internal). If the car is equipped with a hex head bolt, Porsche calls for the bolt to be replaced with a cheesehead bolt. Since the torque spec for the cheesehead bolt is significantly higher than the hex head bolt, I suspect that there have been problems in the past with these bolts backing out and that Porsche went to the cheesehead bolt to allow a higher torque value. However, that's merely conjecture on my part. Using a 10 mm cheesehead tool or hex tool, remove the retaining collar bolt. Before attempting to remove the cheesehead bolt, make sure you &quot;wake up&quot; the bolt by inserting the cheesehead tool into the bolt head and tapping the tool with a hammer several times. CAUTION DO NOT ALLOW THE CAMSHAFT SPROCKET TO TURN MORE THAN A FEW DEGREES while loosening the cheesehead bolt. If so, the valves will contact the pistons and possibly cause damage. You will have to hold the flats on the camshaft sprocket retaining collar (1-1/4&quot;) with an open end or combination wrench while turning the cheesehead bolt. This is somewhat awkward. Because of the lip on the rear distributor housing you can not get the open end of a combination wrench onto the flats of the collar straight on. However, you can get the wrench on the flats at a slight angle and still remove the cheesehead bolt. I've found that using the closed end of a combination wrench, because the head is at an angle, works better. Cheesehead bolts tend to strip very easily. It's important to hold the tool straight and fully inserted into the bolt while loosening. Therefore, a second person to hold the wrench on the flats of the collar while you remove the cheesehead bolt is almost a necessity. Once the cheesehead bolt is removed, the retaining collar and camshaft sprocket will slide straight off the end of the camshaft. Do not try to turn the sprocket or retaining collar while removing. They are positioned on the camshaft by a woodruff key. So, turning the camshaft or retaining collar will also turn the camshaft. Remove the woodruff key from the slot in the camshaft. I've found that a pair of diagonal cutters or needle nose pliers works well for removing the key. Remove the bolts (3) which hold the rear distributor housing to the camshaft housing. Slide the rear distributor housing off the camshaft. In the back of the rear distributor housing, you'll find a spacer (Figure 1, 20). More than likely the spacer will come out with the rear distributor housing as it is held by the main camshaft seal. If so, you'll see a thin mylar (plastic) seal (Figure 1, 23) on the end of the camshaft that you need to replace. If the spacer did not come out with the rear distributor housing simply slide it off of the camshaft and replace the seal. There are three seals on the rear distributor housing which must be replaced. The main shaft seal (Figure 1, 22) goes into the front of the housing. There is also a large o-ring (Figure 1, 21) and smaller round seal (Figure 1, 13 - See NOTE below) which go in the back of the housing to seal between the distributor and camshaft housings. Apply a small amount of engine oil or bearing grease to the seals prior to and after installation. NOTE Figure 1 shows the small round seal (13) being installed at the front of the cam housing. That is somewhat misleading. The seal does mate to the front of the cam housing but, for mounting purposes, it gets installed in the back of the rear distributor housing cover. The picture below shows where this seal is mounted. Install the new seals on the distributor housing and slide the housing onto the end of the camshaft. Install the distributor housing (M6) retaining bolts and torque to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb). Insert the woodruff key into the slot in the camshaft and install the camshaft sprocket and retaining collar. Install the M10 x 65 mm bolt into the retaining collar. For cheesehead bolts torque to 65 - 70 Nm (48 - 52 ft-lb). If you decide to use a hex head bolt, torque to 45 Nm (33 ft-lb). Install the connector into the recess in the retaining collar. Apply loctite to connector retaining bolt (M5 x 10 mm), insert into collar and tighten. Verify the crankshaft has remained at TDC ( ENG-13) . Align camshaft sprocket to TDC using the scribe mark on the camshaft sprocket and mark on the rear distributor housing. Install the camshaft belt onto the camshaft sprocket. Ensure there is no slack in the portion of the belt going directly from the camshaft sprocket to the gear on the crankshaft. Tension the camshaft belt using ENG-10. Install the timing belt covers. Install the alternator and power steering belts. Install the air flow sensor and air filter housing ( AF-01). Reconnect the battery. Rear Cam Housing Gasket Replacement The rear cam housing gasket is not very difficult or time consuming to replace. However, the bolts that hold the rear cover in place can be a bit difficult to get to. I'm not sure why but, Porsche used a cork gasket on the rear cam housing cover. They are notorious for leaking and usually start giving problems shortly after the car has 50,000 miles on it. The rear engine lifting ring is attached to the rear cam housing cover. If the car is equipped with a TDC sensor there will be an electrical connector attached to the rear engine lifting ring. If so, remove the 10 mm bolt that hold the electrical connector retaining strap to the lifting ring and move the connector out of the way. There are three bolts (M6) which hold the lifting ring and rear cover to the cam housing. Using a 10 mm socket or wrench, remove the bolts. Apply a thin coat of bearing grease to both sides of the new gasket (Figure 1, 9). Position the gasket onto the rear cam housing cover and install the cover and lifting ring onto cam housing using the three M6 x 22 mm retaining bolts. Torque the retaining bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb).

Using ENG-13, set the engine to top dead center (TDC) for cylinder number 1. Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap and rotor. If equipped, disconnect the cruise control cable from the cruise control servo and move out of the way. Remove the front timing/balance shaft belt covers (M6 bolts) using a 10 mm socket and ratchet. Remove the front distributor housing cover (3 M6 bolts) using a 10 mm socket and ratchet. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can be done using a pry bar. However, the tool of choice is the factory balance shaft sprocket pin spanner. The pins on the spanner fit into two holes on the front of the spring tensioner for easy operation of the spring tensioner. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. This will allow you to re-install the belt without having to fight the spring tensioner. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. After the tension has been released from the camshaft belt, slide the belt off the camshaft sprocket. The cam belt does not need to be removed unless it is to facilitate work other than just the camshaft assembly removal. If equipped, disconnect the sensor plug retaining strap on the engine lifting bracket at the back of the cam housing (M6 bolt - 10 wrench). Using an 8 mm hex key or Allen head socket remove the plugs from the top of the cam housing. Using a 6 mm Allen head socket and extension or long 6 mm Allen head socket, remove the cam housing retaining bolts (15 - M8 bolts). NOTE Two of the cam housing bolts also act as bracket bolts for the &quot;hard pipe&quot; section of the return line from the heater core. If only the cam housing is to be removed, the return line may remain connected and simply moved out of the way. However, if the head is to be removed as well, the return line should be removed. This will be detailed in the head removal procedure after the coolant system is drained and prior to removing the exhaust manifolds. Remove the cam housing by lifting upward slightly and tilting the cam housing toward the right side of the car. By tilting the assembly you are attempting to keep the lifters in their respective openings in the bottom of the cam housing. This is important if the old lifters are to be reused. If the lifters must be removed, store them in a fashion that they can be identified for correct orientation during installation.

On the 8V 944s, valve timing for both the intake and exhaust valves is accomplished by a single overhead camshaft. The 16V 944s, have two camshafts, one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves. On these cars, the exhaust valve camshaft is driven by a camshaft sprocket directly from the timing belt, identical to the 8V cars. However, the exhaust and intake camshafts have a toothed gear located near the center of the shaft. A chain between the exhaust and intake cam allows the exhaust camshaft to drive the intake camshaft. The drive chain tension is maintained by an oil fed tensioner. Over time, the tensioner will eventually wear out. The tensioner itself seems to be fairly reliable until around 130,000 miles. However, many 16V owners have experienced failures related to other tensioner components a just over 100,000 miles. Most of these failures can be attributed to failures of the J-Tube oil supply pipe or to the plastic guide rails on the tensioner. Until recently, the plastic rails were not available separately. They had to be purchased as part of the tensioner. However, Zim's Autoparts has recently made the tensioner pads available. The web site address to locate the tensioner pads is: https://secure2.advwebsys.com/zimcgi/specials.pl It's a good maintenance practice to inspect the tensioner at 45,000 mile intervals up to 90,000 and at 15,000 mile intervals thereafter. The following procedure describes how to replace the timing chain and tensioner on a 944 S or 944 S2. It was written by Derek Holliday and, although I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet, seems to be very thorough. I've also taken the liberty of providing some part numbers to go along with the procedure. Thanks, Derek. If it turns out you need to replace only the tensioner pads, here a link to a procedure for just replacing the pads: http://boerger.golden-tech.com/images/cam_chain_tensioner_replacement.htm Parts Part Part Number Tensioner 944 105 049 01 Timing Chain 944 105 501 01 Oil Supply Tube (J-Tube) 944 105 167 03 Seal Rings (for J-Tube) 900 123 115 30 OR N 013 807 09 Cam Housing Gasket 928 104 447 09 Top Tensioner Pad * 928 105 509 01 Bottom Tensioner Pad * 928 105 347 01 * Supposedly the tensioner pads can not be purchased separately from the tensioner itself. However, a member of the old Porschefans List noticed that there were part numbers stamped on each of the tensioner pads and provided those part numbers to the list. I've yet to find anyone who's actually ordered just a set of pads and replaced them. Procedure Disconnect the battery negative lead. There are two hoses that run at the back of the cam housing. You'll have to disconnect those two hose to remove the cam cover. Simply disconnect one end of the hoses and use a bungee cord to hold them out of the way. (Tip from Erik Ohrnberger) Remove cam cover. Check inside of cam cover for signs of chain rubbing. Also check cylinder head for signs of chain rubbing. Carefully stuff rags into the oil drain galleries at the lower side of the head, next to the exhaust valves. This will prevent you accidentally dropping anything down the oil ways, particularly when you remove the chain tensioner and oil feed pipe. Inspect chain tensioner and oil feed pipe for signs of wear or cracking. NOTE In my case, the oil pipe had broken off completely. The plastic rubbing block on the chain tensioner had wear grooves in it and a hairline crack in the plastic, so I replaced it. Unfortunately you can only buy the complete tensioner (about $400 equivalent here in the UK) even though it seems that its only the plastic that is a problem. I've heard lots of advice about the plastic breaking up and taking out the chain, cams, and valves with it, so it seems good insurance if there is any doubt about it. Remove air filter housing and inlet pipe, up to air flow meter. Remove PAS pump and alternator belts (and a/c if fitted?). Disconnect wire to Hall sensor on rear of exhaust cam sprocket rear cover and move wire clear of plastic covers at front of engine. Remove bolts securing black plastic covers from the front of the engine using a 10mm socket. Remove upper and lower covers. Remove the distributor cap and plug wires. (3 screws). Remove the metal cover over the front of the exhaust cam sprocket. Remove the ignition rotor from the cam sprocket (3 screws). This next stage I only learned about after I had already done the job but it should eliminate the need to re-time the cam on reassembly (assuming that the cam timing is correct before you tear down). Remove the 3 screws from the ignition rotor and refit them to the pulley assembly and tighten. This should lock the pulley onto the three-armed &quot;propeller&quot; which is keyed to the cam and sits behind the pulley. If you don't do this, when you subsequently remove the pulley bolt, the pulley will rotate on the cam and you will lose the cam timing setup. Credit to Kevin Gross for this tip. Remove the fan assembly from the radiator to increase the clearance when working on the cam and balance shaft belts. Set the engine to top dead center by aligning the scribed mark on the cam pulley with the line on the top lip of the metal cover behind the pulley. Check that the crank is at TDC by ensuring the mark on the flywheel is aligned with the pointer. This is visible by looking at the back of the engine on the drivers side (USA). On the clutch bell housing near the top, there is a square hole through which the flywheel can be seen, and also a static pointer. There is a line scribed on the flywheel with the letters &quot;OT&quot; next to it. There is also nearby a circular hole so don't confuse the two. I found it quite difficult to find the correct hole due to lots of cables and pipes in the way. With the crank at TDC, the notches on both balance shaft sprockets should be lined up with the static marks on the plastic cover behind the belts. The static mark for the upper (right hand when looking at the front of the engine) balance shaft sprocket is a notch on the plastic cover at the 12 o'clock position. The static mark for the lower (left hand) balance shaft sprocket is a molded protrusion on the plastic cover, at approximately the 7 o'clock position. With the crank at TDC and the cam pulley mark aligned with its static mark on the rear cover, mark the relationship of the cam and balance shaft belts to their sprockets, and also the direction of belt rotation (the crank pulley rotates clockwise when viewed from the front). I used white paint for this. If you intend to remove the balance shaft pulleys (which is necessary if you need to replace the balance shaft oil seals), then also mark the relationship of the balance shaft pulley covers to the pulleys themselves. Like I said above, this makes more sense if you have the Haynes manual to refer to. Loosen the balance shaft tensioner pulley. This is the pulley to the left of the lower balance shaft pulley when viewed from the front. The tensioner pulley has an eccentric hub which is clamped in position with a nut and washer. Once the nut is loose, the belt tension will cause the tensioner to rotate and slacken off the belt. Haynes recommend you mark the position of the tensioner hub before releasing it, so that it can be refitted to the same position afterwards. In my case, the balance shaft belt was so loose that I could not rely on the original tensioner position for correct belt tension. Carefully remove the balance belt from its pulleys/tensioners. Locate the cam belt self tensioner mechanism. This is below and to the left of the upper (right) balance shaft pulley. The mechanism comprises a bracket with a pulley on the left and a spring behind it on the right. You should see three nuts/bolts on it. The bolt on the left attaches the tensioner pulley. The top nut is attached to the tensioner pivot stud. Loosen this with a 13mm wrench or socket. The nut on the right locks the tensioner in position. Loosen this with a 13mm wrench or socket. Push downwards on the tensioner pulley to compress the spring. This will allow the belt to slacken. With the tensioner spring pressure relieved in this way, you can remove the cam belt from the cam pulley. It may help to temporarily tighten the right hand nut on the tensioner to keep it compressed while you remove the belt from the pulley. Remove the tensioner mechanism from the engine. It is secured by three nuts which you can't easily see. One of the nuts requires the removal of an idler pulley located just below the tensioner, using a 17mm socket. With the tensioner removed, you can carefully remove the cam belt. Removal of the crank pulley is not necessary providing you take care to ease the belt clear without kinking or damaging it. Once the cam belt is removed, do not turn the crank or you may damage the valves. This next stage is my own method of ensuring that the cam timing can be restored, before removing the cam pulley. By using Kevin Gross's tip as indicated at stage (10) above, it should be possible to eliminate the need for making any alignment marks in order to restore the cam timing on reassembly. The factory method requires dial gauges to properly set up the cam but I don't have the factory settings so instead I very carefully marked the cam and pulley positions before removing the cam pulley. White paint won't do for this, since you need to be much more precise than paint marks will allow. I used a scriber and scribed marks on the exhaust cam and the adjacent front bridge piece which clamps the front end of both cams onto the head. The marks must line up exactly. Next, I scribed a line across the top face of the cam tooth that has the timing mark on its edge. In effect, my scribe mark was a continuation of the pulley timing mark. I used a 6 inch steel rule to keep the scribed line straight. Next, I placed the 6 inch rule, end on across two cam teeth such that the edge of the rule aligned with my scribed mark and the rule was also in contact with the rear metal pulley cover. This enabled me to also scribe a line on the lip of the pulley cover. It was necessary to make these two marks because the existing timing marks on the pulley and cover were not aligned exactly. Very close, but not perfectly aligned. In any case, removing the belt can move the pulley slightly. I can't emphasis enough how accurate you need to be in scribing these marks, especially on the cam and housing, since the diameter of the cam is much less than the pulley and hence even a 0.5mm misalignment is about 2 degrees of cam rotation. These marks will enable you to align the cam and pulley on reassembly. Next, using a pin spanner in the slotted holes of the pulley to prevent the pulley rotating, undo the pulley bolt using a 10mm spline drive bit (12 point bit). It is fairly tight. Mine needed 75ft/lbs to crack it loose. Remove the pulley bolt and its hexagonal washer. Before I removed the pulley, I also scribed lines on the end of the pulley and camshaft, after first lining up the two sets of lines I had already scribed. This was because the rear metal cover behind the pulley, onto which I had scribed a static mark for lining up the pulley, may not install back in exactly the same position if there is any clearance in its attaching holes and bolts. By scribing marks on the end of the pulley and cam, it allows the alignment of the pulley cover itself to be checked on reassembly before relying on the scribed marks. Pull the pulley off the cam. A puller should not be necessary to do this. If using Kevin Gross's tip as shown at (10) above, you will also pull off the metal shield and the three-armed &quot;propeller&quot; trigger for the hall effect sensor, with the pulley. If not, these need to be removed individually. I did not remove the woodruff key in the cam but take care that it doesn't fall out and get lost. Remove the three bolts and the rear metal pulley cover. Remove the four bolts and the front bridge piece which clamps the ends of both cams to the head. Remove the exhaust cam end seal and the inlet cam end sealing bung. Before removing the chain tensioner and cams, offer up the new cam chain along side the old one. To the left of each chain sprocket on the cams, there should be a cast-in triangular pointer which should be pointing pretty much straight up, with the cams at the crank TDC position. The cam chain should have two copper colored links in it. There are five plain colored links in between the copper ones. These links should align with the tooth on each sprocket which lines up with the triangular pointer on the cam. This is on the top run of the chain as you look at the installed chain and cams. It is this alignment of the chain and sprockets which governs the timing of the inlet cam to the exhaust cam and so it is critical to ensure that this is set up properly when you subsequently fit the new chain and refit the cams. Remove the metal pipe from the chain tensioner and head by unscrewing both banjo bolts. Make sure you also remove the sealing washers, 2 per banjo fitting. In my case, the pipe had broken away. I have heard of pipes cracking, so it's probably good insurance to replace the pipe anyway. Prior to removing the tensioner, it is necessary to depress the upper rubbing block against the tensioner spring pressure and to temporarily lock it in position. I did this by first inserting a thin strip of metal between the chain and the plastic, and then inserting two nails into the holes in the metal body of the tensioner, alongside the plastic rubbing block. The use of the metal strip was to reduce the risk of the nails damaging the plastic, since the spring pressure is quite strong. If you intend to replace the tensioner anyway, then this would not be necessary. With the tensioner compressed as above, remove the two bolts which attach the tensioner to the head and remove the tensioner itself. Carefully remove the cam retaining cap bolts using an 8mm spline drive bit (12 point bit). It is very important to ease each bolt out very gradually and evenly, approximately a quarter or half turn each at a time. This is due to some valves being open and their springs putting uneven pressure on the cam. Each cap is numbered 1-8 and there are numbers stamped on the head next to each cap to ensure they go back on in the correct position. Not only should each cap go back on in the same position but its orientation should also be the same, so note the orientation before removing the caps. Take great care not to damage the caps since they are not replaceable and are line bored with the head during manufacture. Carefully lift out both cams together, complete with chain. Take care not to damage the cam bearing surfaces or the cam followers. With the cams removed, chain replacement is simple. Just ensure that the copper links go over the sprocket teeth which align with the triangular pointers on each cam as described above. I compared the free length of old and new chains and couldn't really see much difference at all. However, chains are cheap and so again, it's good insurance. Refitting the cams is the reverse of removal. Make sure the cams are fitted with their triangular pointers in the same place they were prior to removal, and that the chain is correctly fitted with the copper links lined up, before you refit the cam retaining caps. Lube all bearing surfaces before refitting. Make sure the caps go back in exactly the same positions and orientations they were before, and tighten the bolts very carefully and progressively. If you feel any undue resistance with any bolts, then adjust other bolts to even up the orientation of the cam before proceeding. Finally torque the bolts to 15 ft/lbs. Refit the cam end seal (exhaust) and bung (inlet). Refit the bridge over the end of both cams. I used a thin smear of Hylomar sealing compound on the mating surfaces. Refit the cam pulley rear metal cover. Slide the pulley onto the cam. At this stage, don't bother with the &quot;propeller&quot; and metal shield. Check the alignment of the scribed marks made previously. The cam can be rotated slightly if necessary by using the pin spanner on the cam pulley. Once the scribed marks on the cam and adjacent front bridge are aligned perfectly, next ensure the marks on the end of the pulley and the end of the cam are aligned. Then, check that the marks on the pulley tooth and the pulley rear cover are aligned. You may have to loosen the rear cover bolts and move the cover slightly to get the marks lined up. Once all marks align perfectly, you can tighten the pulley rear cover bolts. If you followed Kevin Gross's tip above, then instead of aligning all these marks, you should just need to refit the pulley/metal shield/&quot;propeller&quot; assembly, held together with the three ignition rotor screws. The key way in the &quot;propeller&quot; should ensure that the pulley goes back on in the same position as it was before. However, using this method, you should be careful not to try to rotate the cam by turning the pulley, since I suspect the three small rotor screws may not prevent the pulley from rotating in the elongated slots where the three screws fit. If the pulley does rotate in relation to the &quot;propeller&quot; then, unless you have made &quot;back up&quot; scribed marks, you will need to use the factory timing procedure using dial gauges. Remove the pulley and refit the &quot;propeller&quot; and the thin metal shield, then refit the pulley. Before torquing the pulley bolt (48-52 ft/lbs), make sure all scribed marks align perfectly. Hold the pulley with the pin spanner while tightening the pulley bolt. I had to do this several times because each time I tightened the pulley bolt, the pulley would move slightly. Once the bolt is torqued (I also used Loctite on the bolt), then recheck all scribed marks to make sure everything is back as it was before you pulled it apart. I cannot over stress the importance of getting the cam timing alignment right. If it's not right, then as a minimum, the engine will probably not have optimum torque across the rev range, and worst case is valves and pistons coming together and all the resultant damage. From there on, reassembly is pretty much the reverse of removal. When you install the cam cover bolts, be sure that you don't overtighten them. They should only be torqued to 7 ft-lbs. Cam and balance belts should be replaced if they show any signs of wear or damage, and in any event, if they are approaching 45,000 miles. Tensioner and idler rollers should be inspected and if the bearings are worn or rough, they should be replaced. I chose not to replace the water pump but there are plenty of opinions that this should be done if the pump is approaching or past 100k miles. I also replaced both balance shaft front seals, and the &quot;top hat&quot; bushings that slide onto the ends of the shafts. The oil seals seal onto these bushings and in my case, both bushings had wear ridges from the old oil seals. The Haynes manual is quite good in detailing the balance shaft seal replacement procedure. The cam chain tensioner should be inspected very carefully if the original is to be refitted. In my case, the plastic wear block was cracked and there were very noticeable wear grooves so I bit the bullet and changed it. The consensus seems to be that, although there is no change interval specified by Porsche, the tensioner should be changed at about 60k miles. Don't forget to remove the rags used to block of the oil return galleries inside the head! The belts should be refitted with the crank at TDC (the crank should not have been disturbed throughout the procedure!) and the cam sprocket mark aligned with the static mark on the sprocket rear cover. The notches on the balance shafts should be aligned with the static marks on the plastic cover. If the old belts are to be reused, they should be refitted to run in the same direction as they were before removal. Belt tensioning is best performed with the special tool. I did not have access to this and had to rely on the automatic tensioner for the cam belt, and &quot;feel&quot; for the balance belt. After completing the belt installation and adjustment but before starting the engine, it is advisable to turn the engine over slowly through several revolutions by hand with the spark plugs removed. Any hard fouling of pistons and valves should be detected this way and serious damage avoided.

The coil spring for the cover retracting mechanism is broken or the spring has come out of the retracting mechanism plastic end piece. The procedure should help you determine and correct the cause of the retracting mechanism failure. Carefully hand roll the shade into the cargo cover assembly. Remove the whole shade assembly from the back of the rear seat. There are two large screws, one on each end of the shade assembly inside and approximately one inch from each end. Place the assembly on a large table or counter top. On each end of the assembly you will see a plastic end piece cover. Each cover is held in place by pop rivets. Remove the passenger's side end cover by drilling out the pop rivet (you only need to remove one end cover). Be careful not to damage the area of the end cover around the pop rivet during removal. Once the plastic end cap is removed, slide the roller & shade out of the open end of the assembly. With the roller and shade removed, CAREFULLY unroll the shade being careful not the tear it. Looking at the unrolled shade and the roller, you will see that the roller is a hollow silver metal shaft which is slotted along the entire length with white plastic end caps pressed into both ends. You may be able to separate the shade from the shaft by carefully sliding the end of the shade out of the slot of the roller. If you have difficulty sliding the shade out of the shaft, stop and proceed to the next step. You don't want to risk tearing the shade. At each end of the roller there is a white plastic end cap. The caps are pressed into the roller and the metal shaft is dimpled in three places to hold each of the end caps in place. With an electric drill and a bit the same diameter as the dimple, CAREFULLY drill out the dimples. You will drill slightly into the plastic end cap but that's okay. We'll worry about that later. Remove the end cap with the flat tip which is attached to the spring assembly. The spring assembly is hidden inside the metal shaft and is attached to the white plastic end cap. You only need to remove the cap from that end. Now that you have drilled out the dimples, pull out the plastic end piece with the central shaft and large coil spring. The spring and shaft are covered by a brown paper sleeve. Remove the sleeve and set it aside for re assembly. If you haven't done so already, slide the shade out of the roller. When you inspect the removed end piece and spring you will see where the end of the spring is or should have been attached to the white plastic end piece. This is the typcial problem area. The end of the spring has probably separated from the white plastic end piece or the end of the spring may be broken. If the end is broken, you will have to re-bend approximately 1/8 inch of the end. You will have to heat the end of the spring and allow it to cool, making an &quot;L&quot; shaped bend to fit into the plastic end piece. Once you have identified and corrected the problem with the assembly, re-assemble in reverse order. When you get to the drilled out dimples, simply re-dimple with a metal punch, next to where you drilled out. When you have reattached the shade to the roller and are about to place back into the assembly, you will need to rewind the spring inside the roller approximately 10-15 revolutions. You can make a little hand crank out of a piece of coat hanger wire. You won't be able to wind it with you fingers. After re-assembling the cargo cover, re-install the assembly using the two large screws that go at either end of the assembly.

Before removing the control unit(s) from the mounting bracket, pay particular attention to how they are mounted on the bracket. I recommend drawing a picture showing how they are mounted, especially for turbocharged cars where there are two units. Then, remove the control unit(s) from the mounting bracket. Once the control unit(s) are removed, place them on a clean, dry, flat surface. If the air in your work area is particularly dry, or you have a problem with static electricity, you should invest in a grounding strap to attach to your wrist. Static electricity is your worst enemy from here on. Turn the control unit so that the back side of the module is facing up. Using a small flat tip screwdriver, pry up the casing tabs on the rear of module. When all tabs are raised, slide the module cover off. What you will find inside the unit is two printed circuit boards mounted face-to-face. Separation between the two circuit boards is maintained by plastic posts. The posts are mounted to the bottom circuit board and the top board clips onto the top of the plastic post via tabs at the top of the post. The post are actually two-piece posts which are split in the middle. The two halves of the post simply snap together. The two circuit boards are connected electrically via a ribbon cable at the end of the board opposite the electrical connector. To replace the appropriate chip the two circuit boards must be separated from each other. To separate the boards, place the tip of a small flat tip screwdriver between the slit at the middle of the post. Pry back and forth gentle until the two halves of the post separate (some posts may have a pin in the center which must be pulled out to allow the posts to separate). Once all the posts are separated, lift the top circuit board up on the side of the board closest to the ribbon cable. Then slide the board toward the ribbon cable side. The will allow you to slide the other edge of the circuit board out of the electrical connector. You should now be able to &quot;open&quot; the circuit boards and lay them out flat. The chip to be replaced should be easily identifiable. On the late model cars (1985.5 and newer), it should be the only chip on the boards that is not soldered in place. Instead, it will be inserted into a socket connector. NOTE Before removing the old chip (Turbocharged cars) make sure you have identified the correct chip for installation. On 1988 model and newer cars this is simplified because the DME control unit uses a 28 pin chip while the KLR Unit uses a 24 pin chip. However, pre-1988 model cars all use a 24 pin chip for both the DME and KLR. For turbocharged cars, it's a good idea to mark the old chips before removal to identify which control unit it came from, just in case you decide to go back to the factory chips in the future. Also, make sure you look at how the chip is oriented in the socket before removal (All cars). There is an indent on one end of the socket and on one end of the chip. If the new chip is not installed such that the indents line up, the chip may be permanently damaged. To remove the old chip, slide a small flat tip screwdriver under one end of the chip an pry up gently. DO NOT try to completely remove the chip by prying up on one end. Move to the other end of the chip, slide the screwdriver under the edge, and pry up gently. Move back and forth between both ends of the chip until the chip comes completely out of the socket. Install the new chip, ensuring that all of the legs on the chip are aligned with their respective holes in the chip socket. Again, make sure the orientation of the chip is correct (indents lined up). Slide the chip into the socket and gently press down on the center of the chip until it is fully seated. Fold the two circuit boards together and slide the top circuit board into the slot on the electrical connector. Make sure that the posts on both circuit boards are aligned and press down gently to snap them together. Install the control unit cover and bend the tabs to hold the cover in place. Mount the control unit(s) to the mounting bracket. Before bolting the control unit(s) into the car, attach the electrical connector (and the hose for the KLR on turbocharged cars). Using DME-01, install the control unit(s) into the car.

I've simply put off writing this procedure for some time. If you need to replace your clock, cigarette lighter, temperature control unit, or light bulb for the clock or cigarette lighter, this is the procedure you need to use. Tools Stubby Phillips head screwdriver Regular Phillips head screwdriver (optional - may use stubby Phillips for all) Small flat tip screwdriver Small set of needle-nose pliers Temperature Controls Removal Remove the control knobs (4) for the temperature control unit. NOTE Be extremely careful when removing the fan speed control knob. It has a light bulb behind it and it is very easy to break the bulb or the retaining tabs for the stem of the control knob. It may be necessary to slide a small flat tip screwdriver behind the control knob and apply pressure gently while pulling the control knob off the stem. Remove the temperature controls cover by carefully sliding a small flat tip screwdriver under each outside edge to loosen the trim piece. Behind the temperature control unit cover you will find four (4) Phillips head screws which hold the unit in place. Remove the screws to slide the control unit out. You'll find an electrical connector plug on the back of the temperature control unit. Disconnect the plug and the TCU should slide right out of the dash. Clock/Cigarette Lighter Removal To remove the clock or cigarette lighter or to replace the light bulb for the clock or cigarette lighter, the temperature control unit must be removed up to the point of removing the four Phillips head screws which hold the unit in place. Use the procedure above to loosen the control unit from the dash. Open the passenger's side door (left-hand drive cars) , locate the side trim panel and remove the single Phillips head screw using a stubby Phillips head screwdriver. You will have to slide the panel toward the front of the car slightly to disengage the tabs on the trim piece from the side of the vent. Behind the side trim panel, you will find three (3) Phillips head screws. Remove the bottom screw which holds the trim panel in place. Carefully remove the rectangular trim cover next to the passenger side vent control lever using a small flat tip screwdriver. Behind the trim cover you will find two (2) Phillips head screws which must be removed. Remove the temperature sensor intake cover by turning the cover 90° counter-clockwise. I used a small set off needle-nose pliers. However, very careful as it's easy to break the vents on the cover. Remove the single Phillips head screw behind the temperature sensor vent cover. NOTE Be careful when you pull on the trim piece for removal. It may be stuck and you'll need to determine why and take appropriate action to keep from breaking the trim piece. Pull out on the right side of the trim piece. Be aware that the trim piece will likely be stuck on the right side vent slider. You'll have to carefully push the head of the slider through the slots on the vent piece to keep from breaking the slots or the slider. Also, the trim piece may be stuck the the upholstery underneath. If it seems to be stuck, slide a putty knife behind the trim piece and pry gently all the way around the edge to loosen it from the upholstery. The left edge of the clock trim panel should now slide out from behind the temperature control unit. Installation Position the clock trim panel (if removed) in place with the left edge behind the temperature control unit. Install the temperature control unit retaining screws (4 Phillips head). Install the temperature control unit cover. Press gently on the outside edges of the cover to engage the retaining clips. Install the temperature control unit control knobs. Be careful when installing the fan speed control knob as it is easy to break the retaining tabs on the stem (which also contains a light bulb). Install the single Phillips head screw in the temperature sensor intake opening and install the round vent cover (insert cover carefully and rotate 90° clockwise). Install the two Phillips head screws beside the passenger's vent control lever and install rectangular trim cover. Install the Phillips head screw in the outside edge of the front trim piece. Install the outside trim cover using a single Phillip's head screw.

I generally recommend every 7500 miles for these cars OR at the end of each race season, whichever comes first. Tools Metric Socket Set Jack Stands Floor Jack Measuring Device (Ruler) Procedure Place the vehicle on jack stands. Remove the rubber dust cover from the round inspection port (approximately 1&quot; diameter) on the left hand side of the clutch housing. In all likelihood you'll find this cover missing. I don't think I've seen one on any 944 I've ever worked on. Measure the distance from the front end of the inspection port (edge closest to the front of the car) to the edge of the clutch slave cylinder piston. NOTE In this particular picture the end of the slave cylinder and side of the inspection port are difficult to see. That's because this picture was taken on a turbo with the heat shield for the cross-over pipe in place. If the heat shield is removed it's much easier to see the inspection port from above the cross-over pipe. Also, on normally aspirated cars it's much easier to see since there is no cross-over pipe to obstruct your view. If the measured distance is 34 mm or greater the clutch disc should be replaced.

Although there is nothing about a clutch replacement that is beyond the capability of most home mechanics, the job is very time consuming and requires a great deal of patience. If you take the car to a professional shop for a clutch replacement, the average labor times for the replacement are as follows: 944 Clutch Labor Times Vehicle Time (hrs) 944 16 944 Turbo 1 20 944 Turbo 2 24 1 Two piece crossover pipe 2 One piece crossover pipe Tools Metric Socket Set Metric Wrench Set Jack stands Floor jack Clutch alignment tool (944 specific or Metric Universal) 8 mm Cheesehead tool (12 point internal) 12 mm Cheesehead tool (12 point internal) if flywheel is to be replaced or removed for resurfacing Slide hammer bearing puller set Various screwdrivers (Phillips and Straight Tip) 150 mm long, 8 mm thread bolt Pliers (preferably locking) Hammer Molybdenum Disulfide Grease (MoS2) Other Procedures Needed EXH-01, Exhaust Manifold Removal and Installation TRANS-03, Transaxle Removal and Installation IGN-02, Speed and Reference Sensor Replacement BOLT-01, Allen Head and Cheesehead Bolt Removal Removal Place car on jack stands. Remove belly pan. Remove the exhaust system from the exhaust headers back. On 944 Turbos this means removing the crossover pipe. For early 944 Turbos with a one-piece crossover, the intake manifold must be removed. Refer to EXH-01 for removing applicable portions of the exhaust system. Remove all of the exhaust system hangers from the torque tube. Disconnect the battery positive lead. On top of the clutch housing, cover the timing mark window with a piece of duct tape. This will keep you from inadvertently dropping anything into the clutch housing. Remove the speed and reference sensors (on top of the clutch housing). Disconnect the cable clamp next to the speed and reference sensors (alternator to starter). Disconnect the ground wires (2) on top of the clutch housing (near the speed and reference sensors). Remove the heat shield from the starter (if equipped) and disconnect the starter electrical leads. Some early vehicles will be equipped with a support between the engine and clutch housing (near the bottom of the exhaust headers). If equipped, remove the support. Remove the starter retaining bolts (2) and remove the starter from the car. Disconnect the cable clamp on the side of the clutch housing (above the starter). For turbocharged cars, loosen the clamp on the wastegate diaphragm hose and remove the hose. For turbocharged cars, remove the retaining bolts that hold the wastegate bracket to the torque tube and remove the wastegate from the car. Remove the transaxle using TRANS-03. Remove the fuel filter. Remove the transaxle carrier. Disconnect the clutch slave cylinder from the clutch housing and hang out of the way. Support the engine underneath the oil pan with a jack and a block of wood. The block of wood protects the oil pan from damage. Remove the 4 bolts that attach the torque tube to the clutch housing. Remove the shift lever and shift lever base plate from the torque tube. Slide the torque tube towards the rear of the car. It will be necessary to rotate the torque tube 180° to allow the triangular tabs on the torque tube to clear the torsion bar tube. Remove the clutch release lever retaining bolt from the clutch housing (just above the opening in the clutch housing for the starter). Thread the long 8 mm thread bolt into the end of the release lever pivot shaft. Remove the release lever pivot shaft by holding the 8 mm bolt with a pair of pliers and tapping the pliers with a hammer or prying with a screwdriver. Remove the 4 clutch housing retaining bolts (2 at the top of the housing - 2 at the bottom) Remove the clutch housing and release lever. Using the 8 mm cheesehead tool, remove the pressure plate retaining bolts. Wake up the bolts using BOLT-01, make sure the tool is completely seated in the bolt head, and remains seated in the bolt head at a 90° angle while loosening the bolts. The engine will likely try to turn when you attempt to remove the flywheel bolts. Here's several ways to keep it from turning while removing the bolts: Use and impact wrench. Personally, I don't like this method. It's too easy to strip the bolts IMHO. Install two pressure plate bolts into the flywheel and hold a screwdriver between the two bolts to apply counter-torque while you loosen the flywheel bolts. Have someone hold the crankshaft pulley bolt (15/16&quot;) with a socket and ratchet. Use the Porsche &quot;engine-out&quot; flywheel lock to hold the flywheel in position while loosening the bolts. Clamp the edge of the flywheel using a pair of Vise Grip pliers. Remove the pressure plate, release bearing, and clutch plate. NOTE If the bolt head strips, drill the bolt head off. Personally, I recommend replacing the retaining bolts with new hardware. Also, if the flywheel is to be resurfaced, you should replace the flywheel bolts as well. If the flywheel is to be resurfaced, remove the flywheel retaining bolts using the 12 mm cheesehead tool. NOTE This is an excellent opportunity to replace the rear main oil seal. The next step is to remove the pilot bearing in the end of the crankshaft. Some people elect not to replace the pilot bearing because it can sometimes be difficult to remove. However, they usually end up regretting it later. In my opinion, replacing the pilot bearing is essential. There are three methods of removing the pilot bearing: There are several different types of bearing pullers which will work on the pilot bearing. Baum Tool and Automotion (among others) offer a bearing puller specifically for pilot bearings. You can also use a slide hammer puller with a pilot bearing attachment. The second method involves inserting a bolt into the bearing opening with a head slightly smaller than the opening. Catch the edge of the bolt head behind the bearing, grasp the other end of the bolt with pliers, and tap on the pliers with a hammer. I've had success using this method on other vehicles but, limited success on 944s. Pack the area behind the bearing with grease until it is completely full. Using a wooden dowel slightly smaller than the bearing opening, place the dowel in the hole and hit the end of the dowel sharply with a hammer. If the area is packed solidly with grease, it will force the bearing out. Installation If the pressure plate is to be replaced (recommended), remove the toothed starter ring from the pressure plate. The ring fits tightly on the pressure plate, so a large diameter wood dowel or brass punch and hammer will be needed to tap around the outside edge of the ring to free it. Install the starter ring on the new pressure plate. Ensure the holes in the starter ring line up with the bolt holes in the pressure plate while installing. Install a new release bearing on the pressure plate. You may need the snap ring from the old release bearing if the new bearing does not come with one. Install spacer(s) onto the release bearing. Insert the bearing into the opening on the pressure plate. While holding the bearing in place, lay the pressure plate on a flat surface with the pressure plate friction surface facing up. Press down on the sides of the pressure plate to compress the pressure plate fingers. This will allow enough clearance to install the snap ring onto the release bearing. The number of spacers installed should not prevent the snap ring from being installed. Also, once the bearing is installed and the snap ring is in place, there should be a small amount of movement between the release bearing and the pressure plate. Install the new pilot bearing. Apply a thin coating of MoS2 grease to the inside surface of the bearing (where the end of the drive shaft will insert). Use a socket of the same size of the outer diameter of the bearing and tap into place using and socket extension and hammer. Install new needle bearings (2) in the clutch release lever. Apply a small amount of MoS2 grease to the release lever bearings and to the rubbing surfaces of the release lever arms (i.e. at release bearing surfaces and socket for slave cylinder piston). The shop manual calls for a coating of white solid lubricating paste (AOS 126 0006). However, it's my understanding that this paste tends to harden in the bearings and is no longer used. So, use the MoS2 grease instead. Install the flywheel if removed. Torque the flywheel to crankshaft bolts to 90 Nm (65 ft-lb) Replace guide sleeve in the clutch housing if needed or desired. If the guide sleeve is replaced, torque the bolts to 15 Nm (11 ft-lbs). Coat the inside of the guide sleeve (even if you don't replace it) with a light coating of MoS2 grease. Apply a small amount of MoS2 grease to the splines on the inside of the new clutch disc and the splines on the end of the driveshaft. Before installing the clutch components, clean the friction surfaces of the flywheel and pressure plate. Brake cleaner works well in this application. Ensure your hands are clean when handling the pressure plate and clutch disc. Ensure the pin on the flywheel is pointing straight down. Using the clutch alignment tool align the clutch disc to the flywheel. Ensure the tool is inserted fully into the pilot bearing. Install the pressure plate with all bolts partially threaded before final torquing. Tighten the pressure plate bolts a few turns at a time, alternating sides as you tighten the bolts around the circumference of the pressure plate. This ensures the pressure plate is pulled down evenly onto the surface of the flywheel. Torque the pressure plate bolts to 25 Nm (18 ft-lb). Remove clutch alignment tool. Apply a thin coat of MoS2 grease to the inside surface of the guide sleeve on the inside of the clutch housing. Locate the release lever in the clutch housing and install the housing with the clutch lever onto the block. The block has alignment pins to locate the housing onto the block. Install the clutch housing bolts and torque to 75 Nm (54 ft-lb). Position the release lever so that it aligns with the release lever pivot shaft opening in the clutch housing. Slide the pivot shaft into the clutch housing until it is fully seated. Install the pivot shaft retaining screw and torque to 9.5 Nm (7 ft-lb). Tighten locking nut against the clutch housing and torque to 7.5 Nm (6 ft-lb). Push the central tube forward and bolt to the clutch housing. Leave the mounting bolts loose until the transaxle is installed. Install the transaxle carrier. Torque the transaxle carrier to body bolts to 46 Nm (33 ft-lb). Using TRANS-03, install the transaxle. On turbocharged cars, install the wastegate. Do not tighten mounting bracket bolts until the exhaust system is completely installed. Install the clutch slave cylinder. Torque the mounting bolts to 21 Nm (15 ft-lb). Install the starter and attach wiring harness. Torque starter mounting bolts to 45 Nm (32 ft-lb). Install starter heat shield (if equipped). Attach the starter wiring harness to clutch housing at two attaching points with sleeve clamps. If equipped with support between the engine casing and clutch housing (early vehicles), install support and torque bolts to 42 Nm (30 ft-lb). Attach ground straps at the top of the clutch housings. Cover access opening in clutch housing with tape to avoid dropping washers into the flywheel. (Note: I found it much easier to do this if I disconnected the heater control valve hose from the engine and held it out of the way.) Install the exhaust system hangers onto the torque tube. Install the sections of the exhaust system removed for the clutch replacement using EXH-01. Install the speed and reference sensors using IGN-02. Attach the two ground wires to the top of the clutch housing (near the speed and reference sensors). Install belly pan. Connect battery.

Terry Jenner did a great job with this procedure. He wrote the procedure, took the pictures, and documented everything in such detail (including where the pictures should go in the procedure) that it made my job of rolling it into a web page extremely simple. I made a few minor editorial additions to account for the differences in clutch pedal assemblies. Thanks to Terry for excellent work on this procedure. There are some differences in the early 944 pedal (1982-89) arrangement and the pedal for the later cars (1990-91 944, 1992-on 968). One notable difference is that they use a different clutch master cylinder (see parts list) and the way the master cylinder push rod assembly attaches to the clutch pedal is slightly different. Below is exploded views of the early and late pedal arrangements. In the procedure that follows I tried to document the exploded view part numbers where appropriate to make things a little easier to follow.

It also raises the car to a level you can work at without ruining your back. First, you will discover that, unless you remove the seat, you're going to be on your back in a small space until you get a few pieces off. I don't know how large people do this. Have patience. You can do it. At the pedal cluster, there is a plastic cover over the connecting rod between the master cylinder and clutch pedal. I think it was put there to keep large feet from ripping all that wiring out, but it also keeps you from getting the clutch master cylinder disconnected, so you need to remove this cover to get at the connecting rod/spring clip/bushing. Using a 10mm socket, remove the three nylon nuts that hold a plastic cover in place. There are two on the left edge (as viewed from behind the vehicle looking forward) and one on the aft right corner.     Remove Spring Clip from clutch pedal where the clevis (exploded views 14, 28) connects to the clutch pedal assembly. Simply pull down on the clip with needle nose pliers. Mark with a paint pen where the clevis connects to the clutch master cylinder connecting rod. This rod will need to be adjusted for the proper play when you reinstall the clutch master cylinder. Do not remove the clevis from clutch master cylinder push rod until you've measured the length of the push rod / clevis assembly (detailed in installation section). NOTE On late model 944s and 968s, the spring clip was put there to hold the rather beefy bolt (944-423-387-00) that is mounted transversely on the clutch pedal assembly through the clevis. On early 944 clutch pedals (1982-89), instead of a bolt which holds the clevis, there is a post which is physically part of the pedal assembly (see exploded views). On late 944s and 968s, once the spring clip is removed, push the clevis bolt out through the right side (to your left as you do your gymnastic routine on your back under the steering wheel). The master cylinder push rod / clevis should now be free of the clutch pedal. On early 944s, once the spring clip is removed, you should be able to pull the clevis straight off the post on the clutch pedal assembly. Retain the plastic bushing (common to early and late assemblies). Replace if broken. Put the spring clip, large rod, bushing, and 3 nylon nuts in a ziploc bag. Using rags to protect your paint from corrosive brake fluid, use a turkey baster to remove most of the brake fluid from the brake fluid reservoir. Loosen the hose clamp connecting the blue brake fluid line to the fluid reservoir, and then remove the hose, taking care not to break the plastic where the reservoir connects to the blue hose. Make sure you have plenty of rags under the connections you are removing. You may need to cut the factory hose clamps off with a side cutter and replace them with new stainless clamps available at hardware stores. With a 12-mm flare nut wrench, remove the solid line from the front of the clutch master cylinder. Push the line aside so you can pull the master cylinder out when it's time to do so. Using a universal joint type adapter on your socket wrench, remove the two 13mm bolts holding the clutch master cylinder to the firewall. Place a magnet near the socket as you work in order to catch the nut and concave washer. I stuffed rags in the open spaces below the master cylinder to help catch flying parts. If the paper gasket is torn, replace it with new. Take care to ensure that you don't upset the angle pipe at the top of the clutch master cylinder. If it breaks or comes out of the clutch master cylinder body, you will be where I am, which is replacing the cylinder with a new OEM one. Using slip-joint pliers, gently pull the clutch master cylinder away from the firewall. Once clear of the studs, pull up at an angle to pull the entire clutch master cylinder, boot, connecting rod and clevis from the firewall. Bag the parts. Installation Remove new clutch master cylinder from box. Remove plastic cap protecting threads on front of master cylinder. NOTE The Porsche 968 manual discusses checking and adjusting the clutch pedal push rod (clevis) length to ensure proper pedal position (this also applies to 1990-91 944 pedal assemblies). However, it is not discussed in the 944 factory manual. Since the 968 clutch pedal and 944 clutch pedal arrangements are different, the push rod lengths are likely different as well (haven't been able to verify that). Therefore, on early 944s before you remove the remove the clevis from the old clutch master cylinder push rod, measure and record the distance from the mounting plate (dog ears) of the master cylinder body to the center of the mounting hole on the clevis. Remove clevis and stop nut from old clutch master cylinder push rod and place on new master cylinder. For early 944s, adjust the length of the push rod to the length measured in the note above and lock in position using the stop nut. For late 944s and 968s, adjust the length of the push rod / clevis assembly (Distance A in the picture below) to the length listed below. Once adjusted, lock the clevis in position using the stop nut. NOTE Distance A below is normally measured from the body of the car to the center of the mounting hole on the clevis after the master cylinder is installed in the car. However, it's much easier to install the clevis and set the length before the master cylinder is installed. Therefore, if you add 3 mm to the lengths listed below (to account for the thickness of the firewall) you can adjust the length of the push rod / clevis assembly prior to installing the master cylinder. Otherwise, it must be done after the master cylinder is installed. A = 147.0 mm for LHD cars A = 109.5 mm for RHD cars Cut 16-18 inches of new blue hose. Attach to clutch master cylinder angle pipe carefully with stainless hose clamp. Do not over-tighten. Install other stainless clamp only tight enough to keep it from falling off as you work. Install new clutch master cylinder with hose attached to firewall gasket. Have a friend guide the rod into place on the clutch pedal so it's not jammed up. Tighten the nuts with the concave washers behind them. I used a universal joint on the socket wrench, but I found a ¼ inch drive socket worked without the universal attachment. Your mileage may vary. Install hard line to front of clutch master cylinder with 12mm-flare nut wrench. Have patience, as there is little room to work here. Install blue hose to brake fluid reservoir. Be careful not to over-tighten and break the plastic nipple. Now get back under the dash to install the clevis bolt, plastic bushing and spring clip. When adjusted properly, the clutch master cylinder should have about 1/8 inch of foreplay before it engages. You can adjust this after bleeding the system. Fill brake reservoir to somewhere above minimum (MIN) line. Install empty power bleeder on reservoir. Pressurize to 10-15 psi and check for leaks. Fix any leaks before adding fluid to the power bleeder. After checking for and fixing any leaks, add one quart of fresh brake fluid to power bleeder. Pump up to 15 psi and slide under the car with the catch pan, 7mm wrench, and clear plastic tubing. Open the bleed nipple on the clutch master cylinder and watch the flow for air, there should be lots of air in the system. Once the fluid runs solid with no bubbles, close the bleed nipple and detach hose and wrench from nipple. Clean up where spills may have occurred. Remove any rags you may have stuffed in the area of the clutch master cylinder. Test the clutch. It should have plenty of resistance and spring back. Remove the car from the ramps/jack stands and test drive.

The difficult part of the job is bleeding the slave cylinder. This procedure will describe the slave cylinder replacement and provide some tips that will hopefully save you some time. Tools Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Bucket Rags DOT 4 Brake Fluid Other Procedures Needed ELECT-02, Starter Removal and Installation Procedure Using ELECT-02, remove the starter. Remove the two retaining bolts that hold the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. Slide the slave cylinder out of the clutch housing. Have the new slave cylinder ready to install and a bucket / rags ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. Disconnect the fluid supply line from the old slave cylinder and connect it to the new slave cylinder. NOTE There are several methods of bleeding the slave cylinder. One is done prior to installing the slave cylinder into the clutch housing and can be done by one person. The other is the more common method of bleeding the slave cylinder. It is done after the slave cylinder is installed in the clutch housing and requires an assistant. NOTE Regardless of which method of bleeding the slave cylinder you choose, it is always important to ensure that the master cylinder reservoir remains full. This is especially true when bleeding the slave cylinder as its supply line taps off of a high point on the master cylinder. Check the master cylinder reservoir level frequently during the bleeding procedure. Bleed the slave cylinder using one of the following methods: Bleeding Method 1 Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. With the slave cylinder not yet installed in the clutch housing, raise the end of the slave cylinder with the bleed nipple as high as possible. Open the bleed nipple and use the slave cylinder operating shaft as a pump to bleed the slave cylinder. Have some rags and a bucket ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. When bubbles stop coming out, close the bleed nipple. Install the slave cylinder in the clutch housing using the two retaining bolts. Bleeding Method 2 Install the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. Have an assistant depress the clutch pedal and hold it to the floor. Open the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder. Have a bucket and rags ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. When fluid / air stops coming out, close the bleed nipple. Have the assistant release the clutch pedal. The first few times the slave cylinder is vented, the clutch pedal with have to be pulled off the floor. Repeat steps c, d, and e until clutch pedal operation feels normal. Bleeding Method 3 Install the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. Have an assistant depress the clutch pedal. It should stay on the floor. Connect a mityvac (hand vacuum pump) to the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder. Open the bleed nipple and draw brake fluid from the slave cylinder using the vacuum pump until the fluid flows clear with no air bubbles. Ensure that the brake reservoir remains full during the bleeding. Close the slave cylinder bleed nipple. Slowly pull the clutch pedal off the floor. This will draw fluid into the master cylinder. Check the brake fluid reservoir for proper level. Repeat Step &quot;b&quot; to remove any additional air. At this point the clutch pedal should operate normally. Pump the clutch pedal a few times to see if it feels spongy. If it does repeat Step &quot;b&quot; as necessary. Using ELECT-02, install the starter.

They have been a source of heartache for many 944 owners. The basic problem with the alloy control arms is that the ball joint rides inside a nylon cup or sleeve which is inserted into the aluminum housing of the control arm. That in itself is not a huge problem. However, due to the geometry of the control arm, spindle, and ball joint housing orientation a pre-load is created (for lack of a better term) which forces the ball joint against the side of the nylon cup under normal loading. This results in premature wear of the nylon cup which eventually allows the ball joint pin to contact the aluminum housing. This results in wear to the housing and ball joint pin. Over time, the pin develops cracks and finally shears completely. This problem is more prevalent in cars which are driven extremely hard (i.e. hard cornering, auto-cross, or tracked cars). It becomes and even bigger problem when the control arm geometry is changed on cars with lowered front suspensions. The logical solution would be to change ball joints more frequently. However, ball joints on alloy control arms were not, until recently, easily replaceable. In fact, early on, there were no replacement parts available to rebuild the alloy control arms. The only solution was to replace the control arms with new ones from Porsche. The new control arms from Porsche do come with a two year warranty. However, they're also brutally expensive. Fortunately, there are a number of companies who now offer a rebuilding service for the alloy control arms. Most of these companies offer a two or three year warranty. And, for those who are adept at doing their own repairs, parts are available for you to rebuild the control arm yourself. In addition to rebuild options, there are also aftermarket control arms available which have easily replaceable ball joints. However, these tend to run any where from $900 - 1600 USD. We will discuss their availability later. While this page deals primarily with the later alloy control arms, we will also look at upgrade control arm options for the early 944 control arms. Rebuilding Services Below is a list of companies who rebuild 944 alloy control arms. Each has different policies regarding warranty and core charges. Before deciding on a rebuilder, contact each to determine their policy and current pricing. Control Arm Rebuilders Vendor Contact Info Price for Rebuild (As of 03-19-03) Blaszak Precision Motorsports 4835 Holmes Rd.

The grease boots are not available for sale separately. However, you can purchase an early control arm ball joint and use the boot from the early ball joint to replace the torn boot. The Porsche part number for the early ball joint is 171 407 365 G. Aftermarket Control Arms There are a number of aftermarket control arms available. The options are somewhat limited for early 944s (pre-1985.5). However, more control arms should be available for the early cars in the near future. Below is a table showing control arms currently available. There may be others available that I've yet to hear about.

The first company we'll talk about is KLA Industries, Inc. They offer bushing kits to replace the original factory bushings. The bushings are made of nylon similar to the original equipment bushings. The KLA kit does not include new ball joints. According to KLA, it's not typical for the control arm ball joints to be damaged even in cases where the bushings are extremely worn. The KLA kit currently runs $74.95. Contact information for KLA Industries can be obtained from their web site: KLA Industries, Inc. ( http://www.klaindustries.net) Another kit is available from SSI Auto, Inc. SSI Auto's kit includes bronze bushings instead of nylon bushings. It also comes with chrome-moly ball joints. The SSI kit runs $175 and is a good replacement choice for cars that are frequently driven hard. Contact information for SSI is listed below: SSI Auto 1735 E. Joppa Rd Baltimore, MD 21234 (410) 668-1100 Web Site - http://www.ssiauto.com Procedure This procedure is based on a procedure originally written by 951 RacerX. It has been modified to use the same format used on this web site. The original procedure, with pictures, can be found on the 951 RacerX website. Also, the author is working on a new procedure for replacing the ball joints without removing the control arm from the vehicle. Using SUSP-07, remove the control arms from the vehicle. You may have to remove epoxy material from the control arm to expose the bottom of the control arm ball joint. Specifically, you'll need to be able to get to the circlip that holds th ball joint in the arm. Remove the rubber grease boot from the control arm. Keep the boot retaining spring. Place a large socket over the pin side of the ball joint and a nut or small socket against the bottom cover of the ball joint. Squeeze the assembly in a vise enough to allow the circlip in the bottom of the ball joint to be removed. Use a small screwdriver to pry the circlip out of the groove in the control arm. Remove the assembly from the vise and disassemble ball joint assembly. If you're using a kit that only replaces the ball joint bushings (i.e. ball joint is reused), inspect the ball joint carefully for cracks in the pin or unusual wear. If the ball joint is cracked, it should be replaced. Place the top ball joint bushing into the opening in the control arm. Make sure it is aligned evenly in the opening. Press the ball joint bushing into the control arm using a vise and a socket or seal driver that is slightly smaller than the opening in the bottom of the control arm (the opening is slightly larger than 30mm). Place a piece of wood between the back side of the control arm and the vise to prevent damage to the arm. Apply a good CV joint grease to the cup and to the control arm ball.

Early 944s are equipped with steel control arms which use replaceable ball joints. The big question that most owners have about control arm ball joints is &quot;how do I know when my ball joints need replacing?&quot; Most often you'll hear it said that if the boot is torn or cracked, the control arm needs to be replaced. While this isn't a great indicator, it should raise suspicion as to the condition of the ball joint. Other indicators are knocking sounds in the front suspension or noticeable play in the control arm. The play can be checked by pushing up on the control arm (toward the spindle) near the ball joint. Noticeable play between the control arm and the ball joint indicates that the control arm needs to be replaced. Another question that often comes up is &quot;do I have to replace the control arm if I accidentally tear the boot on the ball joint?&quot; No. If you're convinced that the ball joint is still good and you've simply torn the boot on the ball joint, there is a solution. You can replace the boot with the boot from an early 944 ball joint. It's not a perfect solution but, $20 USD for an early ball joint beats having to buy a new control arm or having it rebuilt. Now for the big question. &quot;Do I use a new control arm or a rebuilt control arm?&quot; The answer to this question is not quite as clear as it used to be. Several years ago, the price of a new control arm from Porsche was completely outrageous. So, most folks were using rebuilt arms. In recent years, Porsche has reduced the prices on many of their parts, including control arms, to be more competitive with after market suppliers. Porsche has also increased the warranty on most of their parts from one year to two years. However, the price of rebuilt control arms is still generally less than new control arms and at least one rebuilder offers a three year warranty. Rebuilt control arms can be purchased from Dynamic European Technologies, Zims, and Tweeks among others. Tools Metric Socket Set Metric Wrench Set Torque Wrench Rubber Hammer Removal Place the vehicle on jack stands. Remove the front wheels. Remove the skid pans. Disconnect the front sway bar from the body and the control arm and remove the sway bar from the car. Mark the orientation of the eccentric bolt to the control arm for proper alignment during reassembly. I normally use brightly colored finger nail polish. The eccentric bolt attaches the rear of the control arm to the body of the car. Remove the nut and bolt that attaches the spindle to the ball joint. If the rear eccentric bolt bushing is to be replaced, remove the lock nut at the rear that attaches the eccentric to the bushing. Remove the lock nut at the front of the eccentric bolt. Remove the two bolts that attach the eccentric bolt bushing to the body. Remove the bolt and nut that attaches the front of the control arm to the cross-member. Using the rubber hammer, tap on the top of the control arm to free the ball joint from the spindle and remove the control arm from the car. Installation If the eccentric bolt assembly was removed from the car perform the following: Transfer the eccentric bolt orientation mark from the old control to the new control arm. Attach the eccentric bolt to the control arm making sure it is aligned with the scribe mark transferred from the old control arm. Torque the eccentric bolt lock nut to 100 Nm (74 ft-lb). NOTE All lock nuts should be replaced with new hardware. Position the control arm in the car and install the control arm to cross-member bolt. Slide the eccentric bushing onto the eccentric bolt. Bolt the bushing to the body with two bolts and loosely install the rear eccentric lock nut. Fit the ball joint shaft into the spindle assembly. Ensure the ball joint shaft is fully inserted into the spindle. Install the ball joint to spindle bolt and lock nut. Torque to 50 Nm (37 ft-lb.). Place jack under ball joint with a block of wood on the jack pad. Raise the jack until it just supports the weight of the car.

Remove the jack and attach front sway bar to body and to control arm. Torque sway bar to body bolts (M8) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lb). Torque the sway bar to control arm bolts (aluminum control arms) to 25 Nm (18 ft-lb). If this procedure is used for work on cars with steel control arms (i.e. replaceable ball joints), torque the sway bar to control arm bolt to 23 Nm (17 ft-lb).

The turbocharger cooling pump also comes on for 25 seconds any time the engine is shut off regardless of the temperature in the discharge line. When the engine is running, a turbo thermostat opens at 82 °C. The water pump then draws coolant from the expansion tank through the non-running turbo cooling pump and through the turbocharger bearing housing. A check valve in the expansion tank prevents coolant from being drawn from the turbocharger discharge line back to the expansion tank. Otherwise flow would bypass the turbocharger.

Due to the location of the drain in close proximity to the bottom radiator cross-member, coolant tends to drain into the lower cross-member, filling it up, and drains out holes at various locations along the bottom of the cross-member. That means you can get coolant draining from several locations under the radiator making it almost impossible to drain the system without making a huge mess. This is further complicated on turbo models where the aerodynamic ground effects extend back from the front of the car directly underneath the radiator. To prevent these draining problems, I usually cut a piece of plastic from an old anti-freeze container or gallon milk jug that is about six inches long and several inches wide (wider if you have a turbo and the ground effects are still under the nose). Fold the ends up on the plastic to channel the coolant and then tape the piece of plastic directly underneath the radiator drain plug using duct tape. The idea is direct the coolant out from the plug toward your drain pan without letting it drip into the cross-member. This isn't a perfect solution as there isn't a lot of room between the bottom of the drain and the cross-member. Just tape it up there and hope for the best. If the belly pans have not been removed, use the 10mm socket and ratchet to remove the belly pan bolts. A Phillips head screwdriver will also be required on some cars. Install a device similar to the one described above under the drain plug. Otherwise, be prepared with drain pans (3 should do it) at several locations along the bottom of the radiator. Looking toward the front of the car, the drain plug is at the lower left hand corner of the radiator. It's normally blue in color but, may be discolored with age. Place a drain pain under the radiator and be prepared with rags to catch any coolant which misses the pan. By the way, in case you didn't already know, keep children and pets away from anti-freeze. It is toxic. That's the other reason you want to clean up spills promptly. Remove the cap from the coolant expansion tank. Using the flat tip screwdriver, remove the radiator drain plug. If the drain plug is badly discolored, it's probably very old and should be replaced. Anti-freeze tend to make them very brittle over time and they tend to break off when you're trying to reinstall the plug. If it does break off in the hole, you can usually get it out with a small flat tip screwdriver. Draining using the drain plug at the bottom of the radiator does NOT completely drain the cooling system. There will still be coolant left in the block in the area around the cylinders. Some maintenance may require draining the cooling system completely. For example, if the coolant an oil have mixed, it is desireable to drain the block completely as well to minimize the number of flushes required to remove all of the oil from the cooling system. If you need to drain the cooling system completely, there is a drain plug on the passenger's side of the block (LHD cars). Part Numbers for Radiator Drain Plugs: Model Year Description Part Number 83-86 Drain Plug M10 x 1mm 944 106 353 00 * 87-91 Drain Plug M10 x 1.5mm 944 106 353 01 ALL Drain Plug Seal 944 106 354 00 **      * Also fits early '87 Model 924S      ** Drain plug seal is included on late model plugs If coolant is to be reused, any debris in the coolant may be removed by straining the coolant though a funnel with a screen. If you don't have a funnel with a screen place a paper towel in the funnel and strain the coolant through the paper towel. Filling the Coolant System Porsche recommends using a phosphate free anti-freeze in the aluminum engines used on 944s. Standard glycol type anti-freeze which contains phosphates will cause minerals to plate out on the heat transfer surfaces inside the engine. I've read that it isn't really isn't necessary to use phosphate free anti-freeze in the United States because most water systems have a very low mineral content. However, this doesn't take into account those who have private wells. I figure better safe than sorry. Phosphate free anti-freeze used to be a little hard to find. However, it's becoming much easier to find now days. I personally prefer Prestone Extended Life because you can buy it almost anywhere and it's not that expensive relative to other anti-freeze brands. Be suspicious of anti-freeze that says, &quot;Safe for Aluminum Engines&quot; on the label. Unless it specifically says &quot;Phosphate Free&quot; on the label, it probably isn't. Usually a 50-50 anti-freeze and water mixture is good for most climates. However, if you live in an extremely hot or extremely cold climate, check the manufacturer's label for mixing instructions. Venting the Coolant System Tools 12mm socket and ratchet with extension. Coolant system pressure tester (Method 1) The coolant system vents best if it is at ambient temperature. Turn the ignition key on and turn the heater control to full heat (i.e. fully clockwise). Crack open the coolant system high point vent. This is a 12mm bolt located on the coolant nozzle at the front of the cylinder head. It will be near the #1 plug. On the Turbo models the bolt is on the side of the nozzle. On NA models it is on the top of the nozzle. Place some catch rags around the vent. At this point there are three different methods to initiate the venting. I will only describe two of them here. The third involves performing &quot;mouth-to-mouth&quot; on the coolant reservoir. Due to the toxic nature of anti-freeze, I don't recommend it and will not describe it's use. NOTE If you have completely drained the cooling system (using the drain plug on the side of the block) or have had trouble in the past venting the cooling system, you may want to disconnect the upper radiator hose (at the radiator), hold it up in the air, and fill the block by pouring coolant into the hose. It's best if you open the vent at the outlet of the cylinder head so you can tell when the block is full. Do not fill the coolant hose completely as it will make a huge mess when you reconnect it to the radiator. When a good stream of coolant issues from the vent, stop filling and reconnect the radiator hose. Then continue to fill using one of the preferred methods below. Method 1 (Pressure Tester - Preferred) Fill the coolant reservoir to between the minimum and maximum marks. Obtain a coolant system pressure tester and attach it to the coolant reservoir. If you don't have a tester, many of the better auto parts stores will loan you one. Pressurize the coolant system slowly until a steady stream of coolant comes out of the vent. Do not exceed 10 psi pressure. Close the vent. Method 2 (Gravity Fill) Raise the front of the car on jackstands or ramps. With the high point vent cracked open, slowly fill the coolant reservoir. When the reservoir level is at or slightly above the maximum mark, coolant should start to come out the high point vent. Continue to fill until a steady stream of coolant comes out the vent. Close the high point vent. The disadvantage to this method is that it is not as effective as Method 1. Also, when venting is complete, there may be more coolant in the reservoir than the system needs. Consequently, the reservoir will overflow due to coolant expansion the first time the car is driven after the vent. NOTE Since the thermostat is not going to be open when you initially fill the coolant system, the flow path for filling the block is via back flow from the upper radiator hose into the head and the block. This isn't a very efficient flow path for filling and may leave some voids in the head/block area. Therefore, it may be necessary to run the engine until the thermostat opens to flush any voids in the system to the high point (vent). After the venting is complete, start the car and run it until it reaches normal operating temperature. Place the temperature control for max heat as this will open the heater control valve and flush the heater core of any voids. After running the engine at temperature, vent the system again.

This is probably due in part to the fact that some of the drawings floating around are of poor quality and difficult to read. Others are just plain incorrect. Even the factory drawings are difficult to read and understand at times. Because of the poor quality drawings out there, some people don't realize that there is a difference in fan operation between the early (pre-1985.5) and later 944s - at least according to the factory electrical drawings and my own experience. The descriptions of cooling fan operation contained in this procedure are based on the factory electrical diagrams, the troubleshooting experience of other 944 owners, and my own experience. Pre-1985.5 944s with Air Conditioning On early 944s equipped with air conditioning, there are two electric cooling fans. The driver's side cooling fan is supplied via a parallel circuit. One leg of the parallel circuit has a resistor which causes the fan to run in slow speed. The other leg of the parallel circuit consists of a contact in the cooling fan relay. The passenger's side fan is supplied via a contact in the cooling fan relay. When the coolant temperature reaches a preset value (normally 92 °C or 198 °F), the temperature switch (normally referred to as the thermofan switch) closes and cause the driver's side fan to run. We'll refer to it as the primary fan. Since the resistor in series with the fan is still in the circuit at this point, the fan runs in slow speed. The fan will run as long the temperature remains above the setpoint, regardless of whether the ignition is turned on. This is a common problem area which will be discussed later. When the ignition is on and the air conditioning is turned on, the air conditioning relay picks up. This causes the cooling fan relay to energize, closing two contacts. One contact causes the secondary cooling fan to run. The other is a contact that is in parallel with the &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor for the primary fan motor. This shorts out the resistor and causes the primary fan to run in fast speed. The second fan has no &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor so when it starts, it always runs in fast speed. Also, when the air conditioning is turned on (with the ignition on), the primary fan will run regardless of coolant temperature. When the ignition is turned on, if a high temperature condition is sensed by the thermofan switch, a contact closes in the thermofan switch circuit which energizes the cooling fan relay and causes both fans to run in fast speed. For a diagram of the early cooling fan circuit (with air conditioning) click here. Below is a troubleshooting guide for the early 944 cooling fan circuit. The troubleshooting guides in this procedure assume (in most cases) that a single failure is causing the malfunction. While multiple failures can occur, it would be nearly impossible to develop a guide to cover all possible combinations of failures. Cooling Fan Troubleshooting Guide Early 944s with Air Conditioning Symptom Possible Causes Testing / Repair Driver's side fan runs continuously. (Ignition OFF) Most likely cause is a bad thermofan switch. Disconnect electrical connector for thermofan switch. If fan stops, the thermofan switch is most likely bad. Some folks will tell you that a bad cooling fan relay can also cause this. However, with the ignition off, the thermofan switch and relay would both have to fail to cause the problem. Both fans run continuously. (Ignition ON) Bad thermofan switch. Disconnect electrical connector for the thermofan switch. If fans stop, thermofan switch is bad. Bad air conditioning relay. Remove air conditioning relay. If fans stop, AC relay is most likely bad. One or both fans will not run. Bad fuse or fuses. Auxiliary Fuse Panel:    Fuse 3 - Driver's Side Cooling Fan    Fuse 5 - Passenger's Side Cooling Fan Bad fan motor. Disconnect electrical connector at fan and take resistance readings on fan motor. An infinite resistance or ground indicates that the motor is bad. Realize that it is highly unlikely for both fan motors to go bad at the same time. Bad cooling fan relay. With a bad cooling fan relay, the driver's side cooling fan should still run in slow speed on high coolant temperature. See procedure for testing the cooling fan relay. Bad air conditioning relay. A bad air conditioning relay will only keep the fans from running when the ignition is on and the air conditioning is turned on. Both fans should still in high run in fast speed if the ignition is on and a high coolant temperature exists (i.e. thermofan switch contact is closed). See procedure for testing air conditioning relay. Bad slow speed fan resistor. Locate the slow speed fan resistors on the firewall behind the tachometer and take resistance readings across the resistors. The resistance should be less than 1 ohm. If the fan(s) will not run at all, you'll likely see an infinite resistance. If the fan is simply running very slowly you may see some resistance that is higher than 1 ohm. Realize that it is highly unlikely for both fan resistors to go bad at the same time.

General Testing (Early 944s with Air Conditioning) If you believe there may be a problem with your cooling fan circuit, but you're not exactly sure what the problem is, the following procedure will guide you through some steps for testing the general overall condition of the cooling fan circuit. These tests check the operation of the cooling fans in various modes of operation. Tools ·     Multimeter ·     Electrical Jumpers Test 1 This test checks the slow speed operation of the primary (driver's side) cooling fan. 1.     Disconnect the electrical connector for the thermofan switch (below the upper radiator hose connection to radiator. 2.     Jumper the contacts in the electrical connector. 3.     The driver's side cooling fan should run in slow speed. A successful test demonstrates that the power supply to the driver's side fan via the slow speed resistor is good. Test 2 This test checks the fast speed operation of both fans. 1.     With the thermofan switch electrical connector jumpered, turn the ignition on. 2.     Both cooling fans should run in fast speed. A successful test demonstrates that the power supply to both cooling fans is good and that both fans and the cooling fan relay are working properly. Test 3 This test checks the fast speed operation of both fans in the Air Conditioning mode. 1.     Remove the jumper from the thermofan switch electrical connector. 2.     With the ignition switch ON, turn on the air conditioning switch. 3.     Both cooling fans should run in fast speed. A successful test again demonstrates that the power supply to both cooling fans is good and that both fans, the AC relay, and the cooling fan relay are working properly. Testing the Early Thermofan Switch Tools ·     Thermometer (which goes to at least 200 °F) ·     Multimeter Procedure 1.     Connect a Multimeter across the contacts on the thermofan switch. The thermofan switch contacts should be open (i.e.  infinite resistance on Multimeter). 2.     Suspend the thermofan switch in a pan of water and heat the water on a stove. Insert the thermometer into the water to monitor water temperature. 3.     When the water temperature reaches 198° F, the contact in the thermofan switch should close (i.e. zero resistance reading on the Multimeter). Pre-1985.5 944s without Air Conditioning Early 944s without air conditioning were equipped with a single radiator cooling fan as opposed to two fans. The single cooling fan is supplied by a parallel circuit. Like the cars with AC, if a high coolant temperature exists with the ignition off, the contact in the thermofan switch closes and causes the cooling fan to run in slow speed (via the resistor in the parallel circuit). When the ignition is turned on the cooling fan relay is energized, closing a contact to short out the slow speed resistor. If the high temperature condition still exists (i.e. thermofan switch closed), the cooling fan will run in fast speed.

Late Model 944s The cooling fan operation on late model 944s is similar to that of early 944s. However, there are some distinct differences. The late model 944s use a &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor similar to the early cars. However, on later cars, there are two resistors, one for each of the fan motors. As with the early cars, the thermofan switch (at 92 °C) will complete the fan circuit, even if the ignition is not on. However, unlike the early cars when the fan circuit is completed, both fans run instead of just the driver's side fan. Also, on the later cars the thermofan switch is a dual element temperature switch with one contact closing at 92 °C for slow speed operation and one closing at 102 °C for high speed operation (slow speed resistor bypassed). The fans will operate is slow speed regardless of ignition switch position. However, fast speed operation is only available with the ignition switch on.

Disconnect the electrical connector for thermofan switch. If fans DO NOT stop, the cooling fan relay is most likely bad. Fan(s) will not run. Bad fuse(s). Fuse 10 - Cooling Fan 2 Fuse 15 - Cooling Fan 1  If neither cooling fan will run, it is unlikely that both fuses have blown at the same time. Bad fan motor. Disconnect electrical connector at fan and take resistance readings on fan motor. An infinite resistance or ground indicates that the motor is bad. Realize that it is highly unlikely for both fan motors to go bad at the same time. Bad cooling fan relay. See procedure for testing cooling fan relay. Bad slow speed fan resistor. Locate the slow speed fan resistors in the passenger's footwell behind the glove box (on the bottom side of the battery tray) and take resistance readings across the resistors. The resistance should be less than 1 ohm. If the fan(s) will not run at all, you'll likely see an infinite resistance.

Bad thermofan switch. Even if the thermofan switch is bad, the fans should still run in slow speed when the AC is turned on. Fans will not run in fast speed.  Bad cooling fan relay. See procedure for testing relay and cooling fan. Testing Late Model Cooling Fan Relay Procedure 1.           Ensure the air conditioning switch is in the OFF position. 2.           With the ignition off, disconnect the electrical connector for the thermofan switch (below the upper hose connection at the radiator). 3.           Jumper terminals 2 and 3 on the thermofan switch electrical connector. The cooling fans should both start in slow speed. NOTE The terminals on the thermofan switch connector are not numbered. Therefore it is necessary to determine the terminal numbers by the orientation of the tab on the plug connector (See picture and diagram below). 4.           With the jumper still installed, turn the ignition ON. The cooling fans should remain operating in slow speed. 5.           Turn the ignition OFF and swap the thermofan switch jumper to terminals 1 and 3. 6.           Turn the ignition ON. Both fans should start in fast speed. 7.           Turn the ignition OFF and remove the thermofan switch jumper. 8.           Turn the ignition ON and place the air conditioning switch in the ON position. Both cooling fans should run in slow speed. 9.           If the relay fails any of the above tests it is bad and should be replaced.

The cooling fans may not be operating properly. This can be caused by the fan relays, fuses, or the thermofan switch. One fan is for normal operation. It should run in warm weather if you are sitting in traffic. The other fan will normally run if the A/C is on. An incorrect water/antifreeze ratio can cause the car to overheat. For most climates, a 50/50 mixture is best for all weather conditions. The head gasket may be leaking. The water pump may be bad. Rebuilt water pumps have been known to have the pulley slip on the shaft. Others have had the pump impeller separate from the shaft. The temperature sensor or gauge may be faulty. The radiator cap may be faulty. If you do not have a coolant pressure tester and suspect the radiator cap, most major auto parts stores can test it for you. Cooling fans keep running after car is shutdown and drains battery. Most likely cause is the thermofan switch. Replace using the COOL-05, Thermofan Switch Replacement procedure. This may also be caused by a faulty fan relay. Look for more on testing the relay in a future update. Coolant Loss The head gasket may be faulty allowing coolant to leak into the cylinders. White smoke coming from the exhaust can be an indicator of a head gasket leak. Perform a compression check using the procedure provided. A cylinder wall may be cracked allowing coolant to leak into the cylinder. White smoke coming from the exhaust can be an indicator of a cracked cylinder wall. Perform a compression check using the procedure provided. The oil cooler seal may be leaking allowing coolant and oil to mix. Look for white frothy residue in coolant tank or on radiator cap (Only on early 944s with oil cooler integral to the block). Check for an external head gasket leak. If the leak is small enough, it may evaporate before the coolant reaches the ground. This is especially true if the leak only occurs when the coolant system is pressurized. Check for hose leaks, leaking radiator core, leaking heater core (strong smell of antifreeze in the passenger compartment), leaking system vent, and leaking radiator drain plug. Check for leaking water pump seal. Check at rear of engine near the fire wall for a leaking heater control valve or hoses to the control valve. Check for a faulty radiator cap (i.e. pressure test the cap).

The most frequent problems include failing to engage, failing to maintain speed, and picking up a set amount of speed after engagement (typically 5-10 mph). The good news is that most cruise control problems can be solved without high dollar repairs (provided you do the repairs yourself). The two major components in the cruise control system are the cruise control computer and the cruise control servo unit. The cruise control computer is located in the driver's footwell (LHD) above the hood release lever. The cruise control servo is mounted on the firewall in the engine bay just in front of the battery tray. A number of cruise control problems can be caused by either the cruise control computer or the cruise control servo unit. If you are having problems and you aren't sure which unit is causing the problem, I recommend cleaning the cruise control servo first, reinstall the servo and test the system, and evaluate if further repairs are necessary. Refer to the table below to help determine which unit may be causing your problem. Cruise Control Troubleshooter Symptom Possible Cause Acceleration above preset speed (normally 5-10 mph) Servo unit Operates intermittently Cruise control computer or servo Fails to engage or operate Cruise control computer Cleaning the Servo Unit Tools Metric Socket / Wrench Set Phillips Screwdriver Small Flat Tip Screwdriver Spray Contact Cleaner Cotton Swab Procedure Disconnect the throttle cable from the servo. The cable is held in place by a clip. Remove the metal retainer off the clip and slide the clip off the ball on the servo operating arm. Disconnect the servo electrical connector. Remove the servo from the vehicle. NOTE It's a good idea to make a drawing of the servo as you disassemble it for future reference when you get ready to reassemble. Remove the operating lever arm from the servo. There is a nut holding the lever arm to the servo. Using a Phillips screwdriver, carefully remove the cover from the servo (small spring inside may want to pop out). A small flat tip screwdriver may be used to pry the cover off if it is stuck. Inside the servo, you'll find a circuit board with two conducting strips which are contacted by a wiper arm. The most common problem with the servo is that these strips get dirty and need to be cleaned. Using the spray contact cleaner and a cotton swab, carefully clean the conducting strips on the circuit board. Be careful not to rub the strips to hard as you may damage them. Check the motion of the wiper arm to make sure it is making good contact with the circuit board. Apply grease to the moving parts inside the servo. Ensure no grease gets on the conducting strips or wiper arm. Reassemble the servo, install, and test for proper operation. Cruise Control Computer Repairs Tools Small flat tip screwdriver Phillips screwdriver Magnifying Glass / Lens Soldering Iron / flux core solder Solder Removal Tool (Solder Sucker) Small Wire Brush Alcohol Cleaning Swabs Procedure Locate the cruise control computer. It is the silver box above the hood release lever. Disconnect the electrical connector from the cruise control computer. There are several mounting screws which hold the unit in place. Remove the screws and remove the unit from the vehicle. Open the cruise control computer by bending the tabs back on the cover using a flat tip screwdriver. Remove the circuit board from the unit. Using the magnifying glass, inspect all the solders on the board. A good solder should have a bright shiny appearance. Poor solder joints will be dull in color and possibly have a ring around the leg of the soldered component. Repair any poor / questionable solder joints. The circuit board is usually covered will some type of protective coating. You'll likely have to heat the solder joint and remove the old solder and protective coating material using a solder removal tool (solder sucker). Once the old solder is removed, clean the joint area with a small wire brush. Re-solder the joint making sure the solder flows into the joint area. After the solder cools, clean residual flux from the joint using alcohol and a swab. Reassemble the cruise control computer. Install the computer and road test.

However, it is often neglected until the CV Joints start to give problems. CV Joints normally let you know when they start to go bad. You'll hear a clicking sound coming from the rear of the car that can normally be pinpointed to one side of the car. The clicking may be heard during normal driving or in a turn on the outside rear axle. Quite often a clicking CV Joint can be repaired by simply removing the axle, cleaning the CV Joint, and repacking. Over time, the grease in the CV Joint tends to disappear, even on CV Joints with boots that are in perfect condition. Don't ask me where it goes, I don't know. If a CV Joint is damaged and needs to be repaired, there are several options. Individual CV Joints kits are available from Porsche. I don't know off hand, if they are available from aftermarket suppliers. You can also purchase complete new or rebuilt axles. Or, if just the boot is bad, you can purchase a boot kit. The part numbers for all these are included below.

Sometimes you'll find it as part of a set of three 12 point tools (8mm, 10mm, 12mm) as they are used in a number of GM applications. However, if the store has the set of three, they should also be able to get them individually as well. Bear in mind before you pass on the set of three that the all three sizes are used in various applications on the 944. The 8mm tool is also used on the pressure plate to flywheel bolts. The 10mm is used on the Camshaft sprocket bolt. And, the 12mm is used on the flywheel to crankshaft bolts. These tools are also known as &quot;cheesehead&quot; tools and if you get them from Snap-On, it's a &quot;triple square&quot; tool. The Lisle tools have the 12 point on one end and a hex head on the other end, so they have to be inserted into a socket to be used. They are also relatively inexpensive (around $8 USD each). The Snap-On tool is significantly more expensive (around $25 USD) . However, the quality is better, they have a lifetime warranty, and the 12 point is mounted in a socket. Metric socket set Channel lock pliers External snap ring pliers Paint marker or bright colored nail polish Punch Hammer Solvent (Mineral Spirits or Brake Cleaner) CV Joint grease (Moly based) Rags Procedure Place the rear of the vehicle on jack stands and place blocks in front of and behind the front tires. Using the paint marker or nail polish, mark the orientation of the drive axles before removal. Using the 8mm 12 point internal tool, remove the cheesehead bolts holding the axles to the transaxle and to the wheel hub. NOTE It will be necessary to hold the wheel while loosening the CV Joint bolts. If the car is low enough, you may place a block underneath the wheel. Otherwise you'll have to hold the wheel yourself, or have an assistant hold the wheel, or lock the wheel by using the parking brake or placing the transaxle in gear while loosening the bolts. When all bolts are removed, carefully lower the drive axle from the vehicle and place on a clean working surface. Use a punch and hammer to tap gently around the outside edge of the CV Joint to separate the collar from the CV Joint housing. Wipe al the grease away from the end of the CV Joint. Using a paint marker or nail polish, mark the end of the CV Joint from the center shaft across all components to the outside edge. Using the external snap ring pliers, remove the circlip at the end of the drive axle shaft. Push the shaft out of the end of the CV Joint. If the shaft is difficult to push out, tap on the end of the shaft with a flat tip punch and hammer to loosen it. Remove the concave washer from the axle shaft. It may be necessary to use the Channel Lock pliers to remove it from the shaft. Slide the boot off the end of the drive axle shaft. Turn the inner race until the balls align with the grooves in the outer race. Then tilt the inner race to separate the inner race from the outer race. Push the ball bearings out of the inner race. NOTE When disassembling the CV Joints, be sure to keep the parts from each CV Joint together. Don't mix them with the parts from other CV Joints. Clean all of the CV Joints parts (races, splines, and ball bearings) with solvent and inspect for damage. If any of the parts show signs of excess wear or cracking, the entire CV Joint must be replaced. Apply a small amount of grease to the ball bearing grooves on the inner race. Using your fingers, press the ball bearings back into the inner race until they snap into place. Assemble the inner and outer races by aligning the ball bearings with the grooves in the inner race and tilt the inner race into the outer race. Inspect the CV Joint boot for rips, tears, or wear and replace if necessary. Apply a small amount of grease or silicon spray to the axle shaft opening in the boot. Slide the boot onto the axle. Place a small amount of grease on the inside of the boot. Slide the concave washer onto the splines of the axle. Use a hammer and deep socket to tap the washer down all the way to the bottom of the splines. Thoroughly repack the CV Joint with grease. Apply a small amount of grease to the axle splines. Check the align marks on the end of the axle shaft and on the CV Joint inner and outer races. Slide the CV Joint onto the axle making sure all of the marks are aligned. Install the circlip on the end of the axle shaft to lock the CV Joint into place. Tap the CV Joint boot collar into place on the CV Joint. Reinstall the axle into the vehicle. If any of the heads on the cheesehead bolts were damaged during removal, replace with new hardware. Install all of the bolts on both ends of the axle finger tight first. Using the 8mm 12 point internal tool and a torque wrench, torque the cheesehead bolt to 30 ft-lbs (42 Nm). It will be necessary to somehow lock the rear wheel while torquing the bolts. Remove the vehicle from the jack stands. Test drive the vehicle, slowly at first, gradually increasing speed while listening for unusual noises.

According to Tim, it saves a couple hours of work. The cylinder head can also be installed with the exhaust manifolds attached. Thanks for the suggestion Tim. Recently, a Garage Shop Manual user reported that he was unable to remove the head using Tim's method described above. So, if you decide to try it and it doesn't work, don't be surprised. Also, in talking to a Porsche mechanic friend of mine, he claims that the exhaust headers can be removed without removing the exhaust manifold studs. However, you first have to remove the center exhaust header (2-3) first. Then the outer header (1-4) should come out without having to remove the exhaust header (manifold) studs. If neither of these methods work, you'll have to remove the exhaust manifolds by removing the studs as described below. Remove the exhaust manifolds as follows: Disconnect the header where it ties in to the remainder of the exhaust system. Remove the manifold mounting studs at the exhaust ports on the cylinder head. This can be done by loosening the retaining nut slightly and installing a second nut onto the stud to act as a &quot;jam nut&quot;. While holding the inside nut with a wrench, tighten the outside nut firmly against the inside nut. Then, using the wrench on the inside nut, turn counterclockwise to back the stud out of the head. The other method is to remove the retaining nut from the stud and use a stud extractor to back the stud out of the head. Unless you plan to replace all the exhaust manifold studs, you will need to use an extractor which does not damage the threads on the stud. These can be difficult to find and are sometimes only available as part of a set of extractors making them more expensive. NOTE The exhaust manifold studs are M8 threads which normally use a retaining nut that is 13 mm on the flats. However, there are M8 copper nuts available that 12 mm on the flats, are less susceptible to corrosion, easier to get a socket on to remove, and make excellent jam nuts. Because they are smaller on the flats, when used as the outside nut or jam nut, it will be possible to get a 13 mm socket over the jam nut and onto the 13 mm nut on the inside. Not all exhaust stud bolt are accessible with a socket but, this method simplifies removal for the ones that are accessible. Personally, I use the copper nuts all the time because of their corrosion resistance. If I need to remove the exhaust manifold studs, I remove the M8 copper nuts, install the factory M8 nuts (13 mm flats) on the inside, and then re-install the copper nuts on the outside as jam nuts. When the exhaust manifold studs have been removed, remove the exhaust manifolds from the car. Disconnect the coolant hose at the front of the cylinder head. Disconnect the hose at the back of the cylinder head going to the heater control valve. Using a 6 mm Allen head socket, remove the two Allen head bolts at the front of the cylinder head. Remove the cylinder head retaining nuts. Start at the middle of the head working out to the front and rear of the head. Lift up the cylinder head to remove. Tabs at the front and rear of the head are provided as leverage points. Use a pry bar to break the head free.

However, it is very tedious and a lot of patience is required. It's going to take a lot of time but, don't let that discourage you. Work slowly, bag and mark all the fasteners, take lots of notes and pictures (to remind you where stuff goes), and you'll do fine. Tools Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Screwdriver set T30 Torx Socket (Air Bag Cars Only) 15/16&quot; or 24 mm socket Paint pen, colored nail polish, or other permanent marker Needle-nose pliers Small flat tip screwdriver Dash Removal Disconnect the battery negative lead. Remove the steering wheel as follows: For car without air bags: Remove the steering wheel horn pad by pulling firmly on the pad. It'll be tough but, don't worry about breaking it. If you have an aftermarket wheel (i.e. Momo) with a center horn button, gently pry around the outside of the button with a small flat tip screwdriver or probe to dislodge the button from the wheel. Disconnect the wire from the back of the horn button. Using a 15/16&quot; (or 24 mm) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and the washer behind the nut. Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft. Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column. For cars with air bags: The air bag can be removed after the battery has been disconnected for at least 30 minutes. On the back side of the steering wheel there are two Torx head screws which are recessed into the back of the column. Using a T30 Torx socket and ratchet, remove the screws. Slide the air bag assembly off of the front of the steering column and disconnect the plug on the back of the air bag. Set the air bag aside where it can not get damaged (face up). Using a 15/16&quot; (or 24 mm) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and the washer behind the nut. Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft. Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column. Remove the gauge cluster as follows: Remove the three Phillips head screws located in the top of the plastic trim piece around the gauge cluster. A stubby Phillips head screwdriver works well here. Remove the two Phillips head screws which thread into the plastic trim piece from the bottom on either side of the steering column. The vents in the center of the dash are an integral part of the trim piece surrounding the instrument cluster. There are several Phillips screws located in the vents which must be removed to remove the instrument cluster trim piece. There is one Phillips head screw located in the vent area to the far right of the instrument cluster. There are two more Phillips head screws located in the vent area closest to the instrument cluster. Remove all three of these screws. Lift up on the bottom edge of the trim piece right behind the steering column trim piece. This will allow the gauge cluster trim top of the steering column. You may also need to pull down slightly on the top of the trim piece to clear the dash. The instrument cluster trim piece should now slide out of the dash. With the trim piece removed, you will now see the four Phillips head screws which hold the gauge cluster in the dash. Remove the screws and slide the cluster forward to access the electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. Slide the cluster forward enough to reach the electrical plug connectors on the back of the cluster. Be extremely careful when moving the cluster around and removing it. There is a ribbon circuit board on the back which can easily hang on the edges of the openings in the dash and tear (don't ask how I know). There are three electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. Each has a set of locking levers that hold the plug connector onto the back of the cluster. Push outward on the levers to release each connector and remove it from the back of the cluster. The instrument cluster will now slide out of the dash. You may have to tilt the cluster back slightly and slide on end out first. You may also need to push up on the instrument cluster opening in the dash to provide enough clearance to slide the cluster out. Be patient. Do not rush. Again, be careful of the ribbon circuit board on the back of the cluster. To the right of the instrument cluster is the odometer reset switch. Disconnect it from the dash by pulling it straight away from the dash and then slip it out of the way behind the dash. Remove the temperature control unit (also known as the climate control unit) as follows: Remove the control knobs (4) for the temperature control unit. NOTE Be extremely careful when removing the fan speed control knob. It has a light bulb behind it and it is very easy to break the bulb or the retaining tabs for the stem of the control knob. It may be necessary to slide a small flat tip screwdriver behind the control knob and apply pressure gently while pulling the control knob off the stem. Remove the temperature controls cover by carefully sliding a small flat tip screwdriver under each outside edge to loosen the trim piece. Behind the temperature control unit cover you will find four (4) Phillips head screws which hold the unit in place. Remove the screws to slide the control unit out. You'll find an electrical connector plug on the back of the temperature control unit. Disconnect the plug and the TCU should slide right out of the dash. Remove the trim panel above the glove box as follows: Open the passenger's side door (left-hand drive cars), locate the side trim panel and remove the single Phillips head screw using a stubby Phillips head screwdriver. You will have to slide the panel toward the front of the car slightly to disengage the tabs on the trim piece from the side of the vent. Remove the two Phillips head screws from the passenger's side vent and remove the vent from the dash. Behind the side trim panel, you will find three (3) Phillips head screws. Remove the bottom screw which holds the trim panel in place. Carefully remove the rectangular trim cover next to the passenger side vent control lever using a small flat tip screwdriver. Behind the trim cover you will find two (2) Phillips head screws which must be removed. Remove the temperature sensor intake cover by turning the cover 90° counter-clockwise. I used a small set off needle-nose pliers. However, very careful as it's easy to break the vents on the cover. Remove the single Phillips head screw behind the temperature sensor vent cover. You should now be able to slide the clock, cigarette light, and hazard switch trim piece away from the dash. On the back of the trim panel disconnect the wires for the clock, cigarette lighter, and hazard switch. Be extremely careful when disconnecting plugs as the retaining clips are plastic and break very easily. Remove the center console as follows: Remove the ash tray from the console. Open the lid on the ash tray stick your fingers down inside and pull straight up. It will pull right out of the console. Remove the two Phillips head screws at the front of the ash tray opening. Remove the storage pocket from underneath the radio. This is done by forcing both hands inside the pocket pressing your hands out sideways while you pull the pocket out of the dash. Remove the two Phillips head screws at the bottom of the pocket opening. Lift up on the console insert that surrounds the gear shift lever. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switches which must be released to disconnect the electrical connector. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you angrier than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily.   If your console has a front-to-rear fader knob for the radio, it will likely be wired so that it can not easily be disconnected and removed with the console insert. If that it the case, you'll have to push the fader out of the insert and leave it in the car. Once you've disconnected the plugs from all of the console switches, remove the spring clip from the gear shift knob and slide the knob off of the shift lever. Set the knob and console insert aside. Remove the trim ring from around the radio (if your radio has one), slide the radio out of the console, disconnect the plugs from the back of the radio, and remove the radio from the car. Remove the four Phillips head screws that hold the cassette holder insert in place. Two are located at the back of the ash tray opening. The other two are located at the back of the cassette holder insert. Remove the cassette holder insert from the console. Remove the two screws at the front of the console, one on either side below the main part of the dash. Remove these two screws and you should be able to slide the entire center console toward the rear of the car to remove it. Remove the two brackets which hold the dash to either side of the torque tube tunnel. The front of the center console attaches to these brackets. Remove the glove box as follows: Open the glove box door and remove all of the glove box retaining screws. There are several screws in the front and on the sides of the glove box and two near the glove box light. There's also a clamp at the back of the glove box. Crawl under the dash and disconnect the hose going into the back of the glove box. You should now be able to slide the glove box out of the dash. You may have to pull down on the top-front of the box to get it to clear the light. As soon as you can reach the glove box light wires, disconnect the wires. If the car is equipped with air bags, reach into the area above where the glove box was removed and disconnect the two red electrical plugs from the back of the passenger's side air bag. Then remove the four Allen head bolts that hold the air bag in the dash and remove the air bag from the car. Remove the sun visors by remove the three Phillips head screws that hold the pivot end of the visor to the roof panel. Also remove the sunroof visor clips (2 Phillip head screws). Remove the A-pillar trim as follows: There are three screws for each A-pillar trim pieces. Each will probably have a plastic cover over the screw hole. Remove the cover plastic covers for the screws. Remove the two bottom screws (Phillips head) for the trim piece. The top screw can be a little difficult to figure out. The natural tendency is to stick the screwdriver into the hole at a 90° angle to the surface of the trim piece. However, to remove the top screw, sit in the car's seat and insert the screwdriver (Phillips head) straight up toward the top of the roof into the hole. You'll have to dig around with the screwdriver to get the tip to engage into the screw. Once all of the trim piece screws are removed, pull back the weather-stripping that holds the A-pillar trim to the edge of the door frame. You should now be able to remove the A-pillar trim piece. The roof panel overlaps the top of the trim piece so; you may have to pull down on the roof panel slight to get the A-pillar trim piece to come out. Remove the steering column trim and switch assembly as follows: Remove the three Phillips head screws for the turn signal trim and remove the trim piece. Remove the rubber trim piece which surrounds the ignition switch. Slide a small flat tip screwdriver under the edge of the trim and pry gently to dislodge it from the opening. Remove the two Phillips head screws for the ignition switch trim, remove the trim piece, and disconnect the wires. Remove the headlight knob by pulling it gently straight away from the dash. To the left of the fog light switch there is an oblong plastic cover with a small notch in one of the short sides (usually the top) of the cover. Insert a small flat tip screwdriver into the notch and gently pry on the cover to remove it from the trim piece. Behind this cover, remove the two Phillips head screws. With the driver's door open, remove the triangular shaped trim piece on the side of the dash (1 Phillips head screw). Under the triangular shaped trim piece, you'll find two Phillips head screws which hold the dash trim piece. Remove those screws. Remove the two Phillips head screws that hold the vent and remove the vent. Remove the trim piece screw just to the left of the steering column and one on the bottom of the dash. Remove the nut that holds the headlight switch in the dash and slide the headlight switch out of the back of trim piece (reach behind the dash). You should now remove the trim piece to the left of the steering column. As you remove the trim, disconnect the wires from the fog light switch. Remove the switch assembly from the steering column. The assembly is held in place by a collar bolted to the steering column. Remove the bolt and collar and slide the switch assembly off of the column. Disconnect the switch assembly plug as you slide it off of the column. Remove the dash as follows: Remove the dash upper mounting screws, one at each A-pillar. Remove the dash lower mounting screws, one on each side at the bottom of the dash at the outside of each footwell. Make sure all wires are clear of the dash and remove the dash by pulling it straight back toward the seats. You'll have to remove the side vent ductwork as you pull the dash away from the firewall. Dash Installation While you have the dash out of the car, check all of the wiring and components normally hidden behind the dash to make sure they're in good condition. Install the upper side vents into the new dash. Maneuver the new dash into position against the felt ledge next to the firewall and install the top mounting screws at the A-pillar. Reconnect the ventilation ductwork to the side vents. Install the dash lower mounting screws at the bottom outside of the dash. If this is an air bag equipped car, install the passenger's side air bag into the dash (four Allen head bolts) and reconnect the two red wiring harness connectors to the air bag. Install the glove box into the dash. Connect the glove box light wiring, ventilation hose at the back of the glove box, and the clamp at the back of the glove box. Install the trim piece above the glove box. Reconnect the wiring for the clock, hazard switch, and cigarette lighter as you install the trim piece. Also, make sure that the vent tube for the interior temperature sensor is connected to the trim piece. Install the passenger's side upper vent (if not already installed) and mount the triangular shaped side trim piece next to the vent. Reconnect the instrument cluster wiring connectors, insert cluster into dash, and install mounting screws. Connect odometer reset switch to the dash (just to the right of the instrument cluster). Install instrument cluster trim piece. Install the switch assembly onto the steering column and tighten retaining collar. Attach wiring as you install the assembly. Install the trim to the far left of the dash. Insert headlight switch through the trim piece, install locking nut, and switch knob. Install the remainder of the steering column trim. Connect the ignition switch wiring as you install the trim. Install the rubber trim ring around the ignition switch. Install the driver's side upper vent (if not already installed). Install the triangular shaped trim piece on the outside of the dash (driver's side). Install the climate control unit and snap the unit's cover in place. Install the knobs and slider buttons for the climate control unit. Install the A-pillar trim pieces. Install the sun visors. Install the center console mounting brackets. Position the center console in the car and install screws (2) at the front on either side of the console. Reconnect and install the radio. Install the shift knob with boot and console insert. Reconnect the console switch plugs. Install the radio fader switch into the console insert. Secure the console (4 Phillips head screws). Install the pocket under the radio. Install the cassette holder (4 Phillips head screws). Install the ash tray. Install the steering wheel onto the column. Install and tighten steering wheel retaining nut and washer. If this is an airbag equipped car, reconnect the air bag and install it into the steering wheel. For cars without air bags, reconnect the horn button or horn pad and install it into the steering wheel. Reconnect the battery. If this is an air bag equipped car, you'll have to perform the air bag reset procedure to reset the air bag warning light. On newer 944s (S2) and on the 968 this must be done at the dealer with a Bosch-Hammer diagnostics tool.

So, when the defroster is operating properly, with a voltmeter you will be able to measure +12 VDC on one side of the grid and 0 VDC (or ground). Tools Multimeter Spade Connector Jumper Procedure Turn on the ignition and the defroster switch. Using the voltage measuring function on the Multimeter, connect the negative lead to a ground point on the car and use the positive lead to check for voltage on both sides of the grid. You should measure +12 VDC on the left side of the grid and 0 VDC on the right side. On the right side of the grid, you should be able to measure 0 resistance from the grid to ground using the ohmmeter function of the Multimeter. If you read 0 VDC on both sides of the grid, there may be a bad connection on the 12 VDC side (left) of the grid. If you read 12 VDC on both sides, the grid's ground connection (right) may probably bad. If the readings did not check properly, check the electrical connectors on either side of the grid to make sure they are making good contact. If you did not read +12 VDC on the left side of the grid, another possible cause is a bad fuse or bad defroster relay. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), the defroster is powered via Fuse #4 (25A) on the Auxiliary Fuse Panel (under dash driver's side - LHD). On later 944s, the defroster is powered from Fuse #13 (30A) on the Central Electric Panel (under hood). If it is suspected that the relay may be the cause of the problem, perform the following: Remove the relay from the relay panel. Turn the ignition switch ON. On the relay panel, jumper defroster relay contacts 30 and 87. Check for proper operation of the defroster.

Why? Probably because it seems like such a simple job and often isn't. Once you realize exactly how the distributor cap is attached and employ a simple tip, the job becomes a lot easier. Tools 1/8&quot; or 3mm Hex Key Distributor Cap Tool * *The Porsche Manual has you make a distributor cap tool by bending a flat tip screwdriver into a 90° angle. This allows you to access the bottom locking screw on the distributor cap. I've always had better success with a long thin blade flat tip screwdriver. It must be inserted at angle with the blade resting against the lip of the nose panel (use a towel to protect the paint). However, it allows you more leverage when pushing the locking screw in against its spring pressure. The best screwdriver I've found for this is a Snap-On SDD1416. It has a 16 inch blade with a .028 x 7/32&quot; tip. This screwdriver is also great for hard to reach hose clamps. The MATCO equivalent is an SCM818P2. I have not been able to find a Craftsman equivalent. Procedure The 944 distributor cap is held in place by 90° locking screws. The 90° tip on the screws lock into raised tabs on the inside of the front distributor housing cover. Here's the problem. The elongated openings in the housing cover are offset to one side. That means that both tips on the screws must be pointed in the same direction to clear the openings. The second problem is with the locking tabs. The tabs are shaped like a &quot;U&quot; . The locking screws are pushed in an turned until they come to rest in the bend of the &quot;U&quot;. However, one leg of the &quot;U&quot; is longer than the other to act as a mechanical stop. This means that the screw can only be turned in one direction to unlock and can only be inserted into the locking tabs when the screw is turned in the opposite direction. Now that you're thoroughly confused, I'll try and simplify it. Removing the Distributor Cap Using paint or fingernail polish, mark the bottom half of the top locking screw and the top half of the bottom screw. Using a flat tip screwdriver, push in on the bottom locking screw and turn in the clockwise direction 270°. When you're done, the painted half of the screw head will be pointed to the exhaust manifold side of the car. Then push in the top locking screw and turn in the clockwise direction 90°. Again, the painted half of the screw head will be pointed toward the exhaust manifold side of the car. The cap should slide off easily. Installing the Distributor Cap Holding the distributor cap in the orientation that it is normally installed (i.e. one locking screw on top, one on bottom). Turn the screws until the 90° tips are pointed to the left (looking at the front of the cap). Using paint or fingernail polish, paint the left half of the screw head (side closest to the tip of the screw). Install the distributor cap. The screw tips should slide easily into the elongated holes in the housing with the cap centered over the rotor. Using a flat tip screwdriver, turn the bottom locking screw 270° counter-clockwise. The painted half of the screw head will be point up or toward the center of the cap. Turn the top locking screw 90° counter-clockwise. The painted half of the screw will be pointed down or toward the center of the cap. Connect the spark plug wires to the distributor cap. Removing the Rotor To remove the rotor, you'll need a 1/8&quot; or 3 mm hex key. Try the 1/8&quot; first and if that's too big, next try the 3 mm. If it's the original screw and you try the 3 mm first, you'll likely strip the head on the screw. The original screws are slightly larger than 3 mm and they are loctited from the factory. I can't begin to tell you how many of those I've seen stripped using a 3 mm hex key. Anyway, if the 1/8&quot; doesn't fit and the 3 mm does, it's probably been replaced in the past (because it was stripped). Once you've removed the retaining screw, the rotor may be extremely difficult to remove. It sometimes bonds itself to extension on the end of the camshaft. Try twisting it off. However, be aware that you may have to break the rotor to get it off. The rotor material is made of Bakelite and is very brittle. The rotor has a metal sleeve inside which can be twisted off the end of the camshaft extension with a pair of channel lock pliers if you break the rotor. Installing the Rotor Slide the rotor onto the end of the camshaft extension. Insert the Allen head retaining screw into the rotor and tighten (1/8&quot; or 3 mm hex key). Be careful not to drop the screw into the distributor housing cover while installing.

The fuel pump relay on the early cars is located on the fuse / relay panel under the dash on the driver's side (LHD). The DME relay actually has two relays / contacts. The primary relay and contact provide power to the DME (and on turbocharged cars the KLR) control unit. It also provides power to actuate the secondary relay. The secondary relay provides power to the fuel pump (and heater for the O2 sensor). If either relay / contact fails, the car will not start. The DME relays are prone to failure over time. This is primarily due to broken solder joints inside the relay. Often, the relay can be repaired by resoldering the broken solder joint without having to replace the relay. Another cause of failures is a diode in the flow path for the primary relay. The diode is replaceable and can be obtained at most electronic parts supply stores (i.e. Radio Shack). Symptoms of a failing DME relay may appear in several ways. Early on, the car may not start or be difficult to start when the engine has been shut down and restart is attempted while the engine is still warm (actually while the DME relay is still warm). When this happens, the car will normally restart when it is allowed to sit and cool for a period of time (usually from 30 minutes up to 2 hours). Another possible failure mode is for the car to suddenly die while driving down the road. Again, the car will often restart after it is allowed to cool. If your car will not start and you suspect the DME relay may be bad, try tapping on the DME relay and then attempt to restart the car. You might also have an assistant tap on the relay while you attempt to start the car. This will often temporarily fix the DME relay to get the car started. If you experience a DME relay failure and you can not immediately get a new relay, you can get the car home by removing the relay and jumpering the relay terminals on the relay / fuse panel to supply power to the DME and fuel pump. DO NOT leave the jumpers installed when the car is not running. This will cause the DME computer to be continuously energized and the fuel pump to run continuously which will drain the battery. Jumper fabrication and installation will be covered later in this procedure. As a matter of practice, there are certain things I carry with me on the road in case of emergencies. In addition to a full array of spare fuses, jumper cables, ATF, a quart of oil, and a universal tool kit, I also carry spare accessory belts and a spare DME relay (actually a used relay which I repaired). Since most people don't have a spare DME relay lying around, I recommend carrying an emergency jumper. Tools 2 wire leads with female spade connectors on one end (for testing) 3 lead &quot;emergency&quot; jumper with male spade connectors on each of the three leads (emergencies and testing) Multimeter (for testing relay) 12 VDC power supply (for testing relay) Magnifying Glass (for repairing relay) Soldering Iron and Solder (for repairing relay) Testing Schematic of the DME Relay: If a multimeter is unavailable, the Emergency Repairs section below can be used to test the DME relay. On the relay / fuse panel under the hood, remove the DME relay (G5). DME Relay Location Using the multimeter set to read resistance / ohms, take resistance readings across the following relay terminals (labeled on the bottom of the relay): 30 and 87b 30 and 87 The resistance across both sets of relays should be infinite. On a digital multimeter, this will normally be indicated by a &quot;1.&quot; or &quot;OL&quot;. Connect a 12 VDC power supply across terminals 85b and 87 of the relay. Using the multimeter, take a resistance reading across terminals 30 and 87b. The resistance reading should be very close to zero (actually between 0.1 and 0.3 ohms). DME Test Connect a 12 VDC power supply across terminals 85 and 86 of the relay. Because of the diode in the circuit, you must connect the negative lead to terminal 85 and the positive lead to terminal 86. Otherwise, the relay will not pick up. Using the multimeter, take a resistance reading across terminals 30 and 87. The resistance reading should be very close to zero (again between 0.1 and 0.3 ohms). If any of the readings taken above are bad, the DME relay should be replaced or if possible repaired. Emergency Repairs If you suspect the DME relay is bad and you need to move the car, you may install do so by installing an &quot;emergency&quot; jumper across terminals 30, 87, and 87b on the relay / fuse panel. Some folks will tell you to jumper terminals 86, 87, and 87b instead. This allows you to only run the fuel pump, DME, and injectors when the ignition switch is turned on. Seems like a great idea on the surface. However, realize that the wire supplying power from the ignition switch to terminal 86 on the DME relay is a 1.0 mm wire and is only intended to carry enough current to pickup the primary coil on the relay. The wire connected to terminal 30 is a 4.0 mm wire which is designed to carry full current demanded by the fuel pump, DME, and fuel injectors. I strongly recommend using terminal 30 instead of terminal 86 to supply power via the jumper. The emergency jumper consists of three leads with male spade connector on each lead (shown below). Emergency Jumper To start the car using the emergency jumper, install the jumper in the following sequence: Install one spade connector into terminal 87. Install the second spade connector into terminal 87b. Install the last spade connector into terminal 30. When the connector is installed into terminal 30 you should hear the fuel pump energize. The car can then be started using the ignition switch. Jumpering these terminals and starting the car may also be used as an indirect method of testing the DME relay if a multimeter is unavailable. In other words, if the car will not start and you suspect the DME relay, install the emergency jumper and attempt to start the car. If it starts normally, it's very likely that the DME relay is bad. Again, when the car is not running, be sure to REMOVE the jumpers. Inspecting / Repairing the DME Relay Remove the cover for the DME relay. Looking at the bottom of the relay, you'll see to tabs that hold the plastic cover onto the bottom of the relay. Pull outward on the bottom lip of the cover and pull upward on the terminals on that side until the bottom of the relay is clear of the tab. Repeat for the other side and the cover will come off of the relay. Carefully inspect all solder joints inside the relay for cracks. Back of DME Relay Repair any cracked solder joints. It is often difficult to tell a bad solder joint. And, since I've never really been impressed with the soldering work on any of the DME relays I've seen, I usually resolder all the joints. As a precaution, I normally replace the diode for the primary relay as well. Front of DME Relay After relay is repaired, install cover and test relay using testing procedure listed above.

Some procedures will have you remove the door panel. Others will have you remove the door panel and the door latch mechanism. The factory service manual has you remove the door panel, window, and rear window track. Admittedly, the factory procedure makes replacing the door handle a snap. However, it requires a lot of time consuming removal which may not be necessary. Finally, there are procedures that describe removing the door handle externally without removing the door panel, window, or latch mechanism. Having never done a door handle before, I did not know for sure if this would work. Since I planned to replace my door handles with 968 door handles, I decided I'd remove and reinstall my door handle just to see if it could be all be done external to the door. Apparently, the confusion over the different procedures stems from the difference between vehicles with electric door locks and those which do not. If you have a vehicle with electric door locks, the door panel must be removed to disconnect the wiring going to the door handle. Otherwise, the door handle can be removed and installed completed external to the door. However, this does require a bit of dexterity and great deal of patience. A door latch that is difficult to operate can be caused by several things. It can be a result of a misadjusted linkage between the door handle and the latch mechanism. It can also be caused by a mispositioned striker plate. We will discuss adjustment of both of these during this procedure. Procedures 1.0 - Door Handle Removal 2.0 - Door Handle Adjustment 3.0 - Striker Plate Adjustment 4.0 - Door Handle Installation 1.0 - Door Handle Removal Tools Phillips head screwdriver Long thin blade flat tip screwdriver Flashlight Procedure Remove the Phillips head screw just above the door latch mechanism (see picture). From the outside slide the door handle toward the front of the car to disengage it from the door and then pull outward away from the door. On the back side of the door handle you'll see a white plastic piece which is attached to a button on the door handle lock mechanism. Using a flat tip screwdriver, gently pry the white plastic piece off of the door handle. Next, you see the linkage rod running from the door handle down to the latch mechanism. On the end of the linkage rod, there is a plastic socket which attaches to a ball on the door latch mechanism. Slide the long flat tip screwdriver down between the linkage rod and the door latch. By prying gently with the screwdriver and rocking the door handle back and forth the socket will slide off the ball of the latch mechanism. The door handle can now be completely removed from the vehicle. The picture below shows the ball on the door latch with the handle completely removed. NOTE With the door handle removed the socket (shown by red arrow) which attaches to the ball on the door latch and the button (shown by the blue arrow) to which the white plastic locking device attaches can be easily seen. 2.0 - Door Handle Adjustment If you are installing a new door handle the linkage may need to be adjusted to work properly. If you have a problem where the door latch will not operate using the exterior door handle, but will operate using the interior door handle, that means that the linkage from the exterior door handle is probably out of adjustment. To operate the latch mechanism, the door handle linkage pushes downward on the lever arm of latch mechanism. If the linkage is too short, it will not push down far enough to operate the latch. If you are having the problem described above, remove the door handle and inspect the linkage including the socket at the end of the linkage. Operate the door handle with it removed from the vehicle to make sure the linkage moves downward when the handle is pulled. If everything is intact and appears to be functioning properly, the linkage may be out of adjustment. To lengthen the linkage on the door handle, turn the plastic socket (shown by the red arrow below) at the end of the linkage rod counter-clockwise. This will made the entire linkage longer. 3.0 - Striker Plate Adjustment Tools 5 mm Allen head socket or Allen head key A door handle that is difficult to operate may be the result of a misadjusted striker plate. When the door is closed the latch mechanism should be very close to center on the striker bar as the door is closing. You should be able to see this using a flashlight with the latch just touching the striker bar (door not fully closed). To adjust the plate, loosen all three Allen head bolts and move the striker to the new position and then tighten the bolts. The striker plate adjustment is a much more delicate operation than it seems on the surface. Very small changes in striker plate position made a big difference in how the door mechanism operates. So, you may have to adjust the plate numerous times to find the ideal position. 4.0 - Door Handle Installation Tools Phillips head screwdriver Long thin blade flat tip screwdriver Flashlight Procedure During the door handle removal, the white plastic piece which was attached to the button on the door handle lock mechanism may have fallen so that is pointed straight down toward the bottom of the door. Before you can install the door handle the white plastic piece must be oriented so that it is point up. In other words, it should be visible in the larger door handle opening (see picture). Make sure that the rear door handle gasket is installed onto the handle prior to attempting installation. Insert the door handle linkage into the door handle opening. It will probably be necessary to turn the handle at an angle to get the linkage rod to fit into the opening in the door (see picture). Align the socket on the door handle linkage with the ball on the latch mechanism. Place the tip of a flat tip screwdriver against the back of the socket and apply pressure while rocking the door handle back and forth. The socket should slide on to the ball. The thin blade screwdriver may flex too much to apply sufficient pressure. You may have to use a flat tip screwdriver with a thicker blade to press the socket onto the ball. Next, insert the door handle far enough into the door opening to press the white plastic piece onto the button of the door handle lock mechanism. You may be able to do this with your finger or it may require pressing on with a flat tip screwdriver. Install the small door handle gasket onto the front of the door handle. Insert the front of the door handle into the opening in the door. Then press on the back of the door handle to seat it in the rear opening. Slide the door handle toward the rear of the car until it stops. Install the Phillips head screw that holds the door handle in place (above the latch mechanism).

Door panel removal tool (shown below) Other Procedures Needed NONE Procedure Near the top of the door panel (front and rear), you'll find two Phillips head screws. The screws are located behind plastic covers. Using a small probe or small flat tip screwdriver, pry off the plastic cover. Then, using a Phillips head screwdriver remove the screws. (See pictures below)  Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the speaker grill from the door panel. If the vehicle is equipped with manual windows, remove the window crank handles. Remove the Phillips head screws along the bottom edge and at the front of the door pocket. When the screws are removed, you'll be able to slide the pocket downward to remove it from the vehicle. When the door pocket is removed, you'll find a plastic mounting block at the front of the door panel for the front door pocket screw. Using a Phillips screwdriver, remove the plastic mounting block. Pull out on the interior door handle as if you were opening the door. Behind the handle you'll find a Phillips head screw which must be removed. This is a rather awkward operation and caution should be used to prevent damaging the door handle. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the three screws underneath the door arm rest. These screws are threaded into the door at approximately a 45&#176; angle. Along the back rear corner of the door panel, there are several plastic push plugs mounted to the back of the door panel. Loosen those from the door by lifting up on the back edge of the door panel and prying the plugs loose using the door panel tool. Use of the door panel tool is not mandatory. This can be done with a flat tip screwdriver. However, the door panel tool helps prevent damaging the plugs or ripping them out of the back of the door panel. All of the door panel retaining hardware has now been removed. The door panel is held in place (actually hung on the door) by a tab on the back of the panel which insert into a slot in the door. To remove lift up on the panel until the tab slides out of the slot in the door and the panel is clear of the lock button at the top of the door. If the vehicle is equipped with electric windows, disconnect the electrical connector plug(s) for the window switch. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the plugs. There are two plastic locking tabs at both the top and bottom of the switch which are very easy to break. I've found that the best method for removing these is to slide a small flat tip screwdriver underneath both tabs on one side of the plug. Then lift up on the screwdriver enough to disengage the tabs and pull back on that side of the plug enough to keep the tabs disengaged. Then move to the other side and repeat. Installation is the reverse of removal.

The bottom line is there is no single best way to modify a 951. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many different aftermarket performance parts suppliers out there. Each car is a special case and modifications should be tailored to each individual's needs, desires, and pocket book. The best advise I can give you is to decide very early on what you want to do with the car. In other words, ask yourself exactly how much performance you want out of the car. But remember, as you approach the physical limits of the car's capabilities, performance modifications will become exponentially more expensive. As a Porsche mechanic friend of mine told me early on, &quot;Speed Costs, How Fast Do You Want To Go?&quot; Next, I'll tell you that although it costs a lot of money to achieve an ultra-high performance 951, you don' t have to be rich to get there (although it does help). However, it will take you longer to get there and it requires a great deal of careful planning, timely purchases, and most of all, a great deal of patience on your part. Heck, I started modifying my 944 Turbo as soon as I bought it in 1993 and have been modifying it constantly since then. When will it end for me? Well, as long as there is new stuff available to try, the aftermarket parts vendors will probably continue to have their claws deep in my wallet. But, for me it's an addiction. I remember a quote from Robin Williams some years ago which went, &quot;Cocaine is God's way of telling you that you're making too much money.&quot; 944 Turbos are MY cocaine. With regards to saving money doing performance modifications, the best way to save money is to learn to do some or all of your own work. This in itself can become costly when you start buying tools - especially some of the specialty tools. However, if you plan to keep the car, the investment in a good set of tools will pay for itself over the long haul. Hopefully, the Shop Manual portion of this web site will help you learn to do some of your own maintenance, modifications, and repairs. I had done work on some of mine own cars up until I bought my 951 in January of 1993. I started doing some of mine own maintenance then but, never really started doing all my own maintenance until early 1996 when I moved to south Jersey. I struck up a friendship with a mechanic there (Chuck Oliver), and under his tutelage, learned to work on Porsches, Ferraris, Mercedes Benz, and others. To this day, Chuck is one of the few people other than myself that I would trust to work on my car. I'd also help him hide a body if he asked. In this particular discussion, we will deal only with engine performance modifications. Suspension and brake modifications will be discussed in other procedures. For the most part, I will stay away from making recommendations about specific products. What I will do at the end of this procedure is provide a list of various performance parts suppliers and some of the things they offer. Then, it will be up to you to decide what is the best course of action for your particular needs. Now that I've bored you to tears with all of the preliminary stuff, let's get down to business. Computer Chips You absolutely can not buy horsepower for a 944 Turbo cheaper than investing in a set of computer chips. For a little more than $500 USD, you can install a set of chips in your DME and KLR and pickup as much as 60 HP. They really make a huge difference in the performance of a stock 944 Turbo. So, how do the chips achieve these horsepower gains? Well, most of them function in essentially the same fashion. 944 Turbos run a maximum stock boost of around 11 psi with an overboost protection set somewhere above that (don't remember exactly where). Aftermarket chips will raise or in some cases eliminate the overboost protection set point and will raise the maximum boost pressure allowed by the boost control system (typically to around 14-15 psi). In addition to the setpoint increase for the boost control system, some setups may come with a device to retard the pressure build up from the turbocharger discharge to the wastegate. Typically, you'll see this in the form of an orifice in the sensing line from the turbocharger discharge to the cycling valve (which controls the wastegate) or by use of a bleeder valve in the line from the cycling valve to the wastegate. For a complete description of how the 951 boost control system works, refer to the 951 FAQ. Also, within the chip set, the fuel and ignition maps are typically modified to match the engines demands at the new higher boost levels. The advantage of using chips is, as we said before, that they are relatively inexpensive for the amount of horsepower gained. They are also relatively easy to install and are well within the capabilities of most shade tree mechanics with a limited number of tools. So, what are the disadvantages? First, for the chips to work to maximum advantage they have to be matched to the system you're running. If you're starting out with a completely stock 944 Turbo, that's not a problem. However, if you install a set of chips and then down the road decide to make other modifications (i.e. different turbocharger), your chips are no longer matched to your system. So, now you have to try and get another set of chips which are matched to your new setup or you have to pay someone to custom map you a set of chips. That can become costly in a big hurry. In theory, you could have a set of chips custom mapped for any setup you decide to use. However, the costs in dyno time along would quickly make such a practice prohibitive. If don't plan to do a lot of performance modifications, a set of chips is definitely the way to go. However, if you think you're going to want other modifications down the road, chips are a waste of money because you'll eventually end up throwing them away. In that case, you're better of saving up your money for a fuel management or stand alone engine management system. Air Flow Measurement Accurate air flow measurement is the single most important variable in any engine management system. The stock air flow meter is a &quot;barn door&quot; type air flow measurement where a door or gate inside the units swings open to various positions based on the amount of air flow through the sensor. These also use a temperature sensor for density compensation of the air flow signal. Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensors use a heated wire element. As air flow increases across the wire it cools changing the resistance of the wire. The measured resistance of the wire can be directly correlated to a specific amount of air flow across the wire. MAF systems may or may not use an inlet air temperature sensor for density compensation. Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensors measure the pressure in the intake manifold. It is then density compensated by a signal from an inlet air temperature sensor to determine the amount of air flow into the intake manifold. The use of MAP sensors is a fairly recent addition to the 944 performance market and are primarily being used with stand alone engine management systems. The great advantage for both MAF and MAP sensors is that they typically provide a more accurate measurement of air flow than a barn door meter and they also eliminate a huge restriction in the air flow path coming into the intake manifold. MAF and MAP systems may be controlled via a special set of chips for the stock engine management computer. Or, they may be used in conjunction with a fuel management or stand alone engine management system to control the signals going to the fuel injectors. MAF and MAP systems will typically run in the range of $1200-2200 range depending on whether they use chips or a fuel management system. Fuel Management Systems The main advantage to a fuel control system is that you can make modifications to your car without having to worry about buying another set of chips or getting chips custom mapped. Most of the fuel management systems out there are &quot;piggyback&quot; systems which means that they tap into the existing engine management so that you can manipulate the pulse signals going to the fuel injectors. These are typically used in conjunction with an Air/Fuel ratio meter which you monitor for proper A/F mixtures as you tune the system. Fuel management systems will typically have some type of control module which can be programmed via dials on the front of the unit or using a laptop computer to manipulate the fuel maps on the chip inside the module. The system may operate with the stock air flow meter, or it may require the installation of a Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor, or even a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor. Fuel management systems are generally fairly easy to install and setup. However, they do have limitations with regards to the level of control you have over the signals sent to the injectors and they do not offer any control over ignition timing. And, control over ignition timing is extremely important in ultra-high performance applications. While there are separate ignition control systems available, bear in mind that with separate systems the ignition and fuel systems are working independently of each other. If they are not set up properly, the two systems can actually work against each other. Stand Alone Engine Management Systems Stand Alone Engine Management Systems derive their name from the fact that the completely replace the existing engine management system. This means that there is a great deal of work to be done when installing a stand alone system. These system may require replacing engine wiring harness completely and may require replacing most or all of the factory sensors. The obvious disadvantage to this is that it requires a great deal of work to replace existing wiring. You may also have to do some fabrication to use aftermarket sensors with the 944 engine. However, these disadvantages can work to your advantage as well. Since we are installing these systems on cars that are at least 10-15 years old, much of the car's factory wiring harness probably needs replacing anyway. And, aftermarket sensors (most of them typically GM) are normally cheaper than factory sensors. While a few of the stand alone systems can use the factory crank trigger signal pickup, most will require a crankshaft trigger wheel and sensor be mounted on the front of the engine. This presents problems with regards to sensor mounting and pulley arrangement. However, isn't like you're blazing a trail because someone else has already addressed these issues and can provide you with a solution. The primary advantage of stand alone systems is that you get complete control over the ignition and fuel maps in one location so that the system can operate as a single unit. Which means that no matter what modifications you make in the future, you'll be able to reprogram the system to compensate for the change in your setup. In addition to both fuel and ignition control, many of the stand alone systems use direct fire ignition via coil packs. This allows you to completely do away with the distributor and provide a more reliable spark to the engine. Other features which may be available with a stand alone system are: data logging, knock control, boost control, NOS control, and even engine cooling fan control. Additionally, with the use of a cam trigger in addition to the crank trigger, you can go to a true sequential fuel injection. The biggest disadvantage to stand alone systems is cost. Be prepared to spend $2500-3500 USD for a decent system and really high end stuff can run well over $8000 USD. For the most part, however, the less expensive systems will do as much or more than the expensive systems. Another disadvantage to stand alone systems is the installation and setup. It can take a great deal of time to install, learn how to use, and properly setup a stand alone system. Turbochargers In the early days of performance modifications about the first thing to become popular was changing to different computer chips. Shortly thereafter, the holy grail of horsepower improvement became bigger turbochargers. That philosophy was brought about in part by Porsche itself when it changed from a K26-6 turbocharger on the early 951s to a K26-8 on the later cars. After that, folks figured that they could achieve progressively greater performance by installing progressively larger turbochargers. It didn't take long for folks to figure out (myself included) that for peak performance the turbocharger must be matched to your existing air flow capabilities with a fuel management system (either remapped chips or a different management system) that is setup to provide the correct amount of fuel for your engine and turbocharger. If your engine can not provide enough air flow or even provides too much air flow for your turbocharger, it will not be operating at peak efficiency and performance will suffer dramatically. I installed a K27-8 turbocharger on my 2.5L 944 Turbo in 1994. I was so disappointed, that I almost pulled it off and threw it in the trash. There was no noticeable improvement in performance and the increase in turbo lag was, in my opinion, completely unacceptable. Fortunately, when I later increased the engine's displacement to 2.8L, the turbo appears to be an almost perfect match. However, the fact that it does seem to be such a good match is more chance than anything else. With everything else remaining stock (i.e. displacement, cylinder head, intercooler), choosing a different turbocharger is much easier. Since the stock air flow rate capability of the stock 2.5L engine is fairly fixed, matching a turbocharger to that flow rate capability is more exacting. However, when you start changing displacement, going to higher flow rate heads, or bigger intercoolers, selecting a turbocharger becomes more hit or miss. If you have made a displacement change, changed to a different flow rate head, or installed a larger intercooler, provide all that information to your turbocharger supplier. Ideally, if you've changed to a different head, the head will have been bench flowed and those flow rate numbers provide to you with the purchase of the head. Try to select a turbocharger supplier who has a great deal of experience with providing different turbos for different combinations of engine displacement and head flow rates. Your chances of getting a better matched turbo will improve. Also, if you're using the stock engine management system make sure (up front) that your turbo supplier can also provide you with a set of chips mapped specifically for your new setup. If you're using a fuel management system or stand alone engine management system this isn't of concern as you can re-tune your system as necessary. Adjustable Fuel Pressure Regulators For low end applications where you are perhaps running a set of aftermarket chips, a different turbocharger, and boost up to about 15 psi, installing an adjustable fuel pressure regulator is, for the most part, a waste of money. The only reason for going to an adjustable fuel pressure regulator is when you're trying to make bigger horsepower numbers with stock injectors and they simply won't flow enough fuel with the lower differential pressure across the injector. If that is the case, you should be using the adjustable FPR in conjunction with a set of chips that are mapped for the fuel pressure you're running. For example some chip manufacturers may have you install an adjustable fuel pressure regulator along with their chips and adjust the base fuel pressure for 44 psi as opposed to the stock 36 psi. In my particular case, running a MAF system with a maximum boost pressure set at 18 psi, the vendor that supplied the MAF and the chips that came with it specified running the base fuel pressure at 52 psi with stock injectors. What I'm saying here is don't go out and simply plunk down your hard earned money on an adjustable FPR alone and expect it to do anything for you. If you do so, it must be for the express purpose of setting a specific fuel pressure for a specific application. Fuel Injectors Another common misconception floating around is that improved performance can be obtained by simply installing a bigger set of injectors. Not only is that incorrect but, you can also damage your DME computer in the process. There are basically two types of injectors on the market, high impedance injectors (with resistances typically greater than 10 ohms) and low impedance injectors which NORMALLY have resistances in the 2-3 ohm range. High impedance injectors are referred to as saturation injectors and low impedance injectors are called peak and hold injectors. The stock engine management computer uses two injector drivers with the two injectors batch fired (both fire at the same time). If you try to use injectors of a different resistance than what the injector driver is designed for, it can cause the injector driver to shut down or even burn up. Now, all 944s use low impedance peak and hold injectors. However, the 944 Turbo uses and injector with a resistance of 4.5 ohms (spec is 3.5 to 5.5 ohms). So, how many low impedance injectors do you think there are with a resistance of 4.5 ohms (Other than the ones used in the 944 Turbo)? If you guess somewhere around none, you're absolutely correct. So, what must we do to run bigger injectors? Well, we have to do some impedance matching. That's really just a fancy term for making a resistor of a different resistance than the one you currently have appear like it has the same resistance. For example, since most low impedance injectors come in the 2-3 ohm range, we need to make two 2-3 ohm injectors wired in parallel look like two 4.5 ohm injectors wired in parallel (remember two injectors batch fired off of each injector driver). I won't go into the theory behind series and parallel resistance circuits but, to the injector driver, two 4.5 ohm injectors wired in parallel to the driver provides and equivalent resistance to the driver of 2.25 ohms (press the &quot;I believe&quot; button now). Now, let's say we want to install bigger injectors with have a resistance of 2.5 ohms. Wired in parallel to the injector driver, these provide and equivalent resistance of 1.25 ohms. So, to get up to the 2.25 ohms resistance the driver is happy with, we need to install a single 1 ohm resistor in series (commonly referred to as a ballast resistor) with the two parallel wired 2.5 ohm injectors. Now that I've gone through that long and boring explanation, I'll tell you that there are plenty of aftermarket suppliers out there who have already done all the calculations and will supply you with a set of bigger injectors and the appropriate ballast resistors to impedance match them to the stock DME injector drivers. Hope I didn't make you mad by making you sit through that explanation. However, it's my opinion that the more information you have, the more understanding you have about how your car works. With greater understanding comes better decision making when it comes to selecting equipment for performance modifications (as I climb slowly down off my soap box). Once again, bigger injectors are of little use unless you have a set of chips which are mapped based on the bigger injector capability or a tuneable fuel management system. By now you should be seeing a recurring theme here. That being, if you are to continue down the evil path of performance modifications, it is in the best interest of your sanity and pocket book to install a fuel management or stand alone engine management system early on in the game. Increasing Engine Displacement This section on increasing engine displacement is the sole reason I decided to write this document on 951 performance modifications. There is so much misunderstanding and misinformation floating around about increasing engine displacement, I thought it was time to put out as much information on the subject as possible so that folks will be able to make informed decisions with regards to increasing displacement. There are several ways to go about increasing engine displacement on a 944 and none of them are cheap. You can increase the bore and keep the same stroke, you can increase the stroke and keep the same bore, or you can increase both the bore and the stroke (insert Tim Allen grunt here). Bottom line is, if you plan to do an increase in displacement, you'd better have very deep pockets or plan to purchase components over a long period of time to spread out the cost (as I did). I don't know who originally came up with the idea of increasing the displacement of a 944 Turbo but, early on, the only company out there offering anything was Andial. The were one of if not the first companies to offer a stroker kit for the 951. It consisted of a new 3.0L 944 S2 crankshaft, Carillo rods, and Mahle pistons which were custom made for Andial specifically for this applications. The price tag for the kit used to run somewhere in the neighborhood of $5500 USD with over $3000 USD for a new crankshaft from Porsche. One of the questions I always get asked about stroker kits is, &quot;hey, is all that stuff required&quot;? Well, to do a stroker kit, you obviously need the 3.0L crankshaft to give you the increased stroke. However, there's nothing that says you have to use a new crankshaft. When I did my stroker engine, I bought the pistons and rods from Andial and shopped around until I found a used crankshaft ($1100 USD). Now days, you can pick up a used crankshaft for $1200-1500 USD. I can't tell you how much the pistons and rods are going for today but, in 1996 the Mahle pistons were approximately $1250 and the Carillo rods about $950. The pistons are a requirement because you need a higher wrist pin location to provide valve/cylinder head clearance at TDC with the increase in stroke. The Mahle pistons are specially coated with iron to be compatible with the stock silicon impregnated alloy cylinder walls. They also have a set of moly rings which are also compatible with the alloy surface. The rods are not strictly required. However, if you stick with the factory connecting rods the sides of the main bearing saddles on the block have to be machined. The stock connecting rods have a very tall shoulder for the rod bolt. With the increase in stroke, the shoulder will come in contact with a lip on the side of the bearing saddle. So, the excess material has to be machined away to provide enough clearance. This isn't really a big deal as it's what Porsche had to do when they built the 3.0L S2 engine anyway. However, it's going to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $400-500 to have the block machined. The Carillo rods have a lower rod bolt shoulder, so they do not require the block to be machined and they are lighter and stronger than the factory connecting rod. I debated about whether to use the factory rod and ultimately decided to go with the stronger aftermarket rod. Now days, there are many places that are offering stroker kits for 944 Turbos. The primary difference between most of these kits and the Andial kit is that they require the cylinder to be bored and a cast iron sleeve installed. Then, you can use a custom piston which does not require special coatings or special rings. J&E and Cunningham are the leading manufacturers producing custom pistons for these applications. It will cost you a little more to have the cylinders bored and sleeved but, the cost of the pistons is less so, the ultimate cost is about the same. One advantage to sleeving is that it allows the cylinder to hold up much better in the event of a catastrophic failure (i.e. a ring breaks). It also allows you to get a custom made piston in just about any size you want if you want to increase the bore. As far as I'm aware, the Mahle pistons are only available in 100 mm and 100.05 mm diameters. We'll discuss what displacements are achieved with different combinations of bore and stroke a little later. Another method of increasing displacement is to increase the bore and keeping the same stroke. This is typically less expensive than stroking an engine because it doesn't require you to buy a 3.0L crankshaft. Also, bored engines tend to develop more torque than stroked engines of similar displacement. However, I've never been a huge fan of boring the 2.5L block. The reason being that the cylinder walls on the 2.5L block aren't all that thick to begin with. And the 2.5L cylinders are free standing in the block which means they are unsupported at the top. When you overbore the block for a displacement increase, cylinder walls get very thin and even with cast iron sleeves, the cylinders are weakened to the point that they have been known to move at extremely high loads. And when the cylinders start moving, you start blowing head gaskets. For over bore applications, the 3.0L block is a much better candidate for boring. The cylinder walls are much beefier than the 2.5L block to begin with and the cylinders are tied together at the top with webbing for additional support. Then of course if you want to go to a really large displacement engine, you can go to an engine that is bored and stroked. Again, the 3.0L block is a much better candidate for this type of displacement increase. So, let's talk actual numbers. The bore and stroke of the 2.5L engine is 100 mm x 78.9 mm. If you calculate the numbers, the actual displacement is 2.479L. For the 3.0L engine ( Bore = 104 mm, Stroke = 87.8 mm), the actual displacement is 2.983L. Now, if we install a 3.0L crankshaft into a standard bore 2.5L engine, we increase the displacement to 2.758L. This is what we typically refer to as the 2.8L stroker engine. If we bore and sleeve the engine to 104 mm (standard 3.0L bore) and keep the 2.5L crankshaft, we increase the displacement to 2.680L (commonly referred to as a 2.7L). I have seen the 2.5L engine bored and sleeved to as much as 106 mm which with a 2.5L crankshaft yields a displacement of 2.785L. This is actually a slight increase in displacement over what most stroker kits provide in displacement. However, over the long haul it isn't nearly as reliable. For displacements larger than 3.0L, the 3.0L 944 S2 or 968 block should be used as a starting point. However, using the 3.0L block does pose some problems. The biggest problem has to do with the cylinder head. The 944 Turbo cylinder head will not mate up to the 3.0L block due to the difference in cooling passages at the front of the cylinder head. There are several possible solutions to this problem. First, you can have the 944 Turbo cylinder head modified so that it will mate directly to the 3.0L block. This involves welding a boss on to the cooling passage at the front of the head and then machining a new cooling passage to mate up with the 3.0L block. There are several 944 performance shops who are doing this and I have yet to hear anything negative about going this route. However, bear in mind that there aren't a lot of people out there doing 3.0L+ engines in 944s. The cost for modifying the 944 Turbo head is about $350. The next option is to obtain a cylinder head from a normally aspirated 1989 944. This was a 2.7L engine that was only made by Porsche for one model year and the 2.7L engines are somewhat rare. Most of the normally aspirated cars produced in 1989 were the 3.0L 944 S2 engines which utilized a 16V head. The 2.7L engine used the same block as the S2 engine but, used and 8V head and the 2.5L crankshaft. So, the 2.7L head will mate directly to the 3.0L block without modification. However, you will need to swap to a high temperature exhaust valve similar to the one used in the 951 head. If I'm not mistaken, the 2.7L valve has a different diameter stem than the turbo valves. So, if you wanted to use the 944 Turbo valves you'd also have to change to the 951 valve guides. The final, and by far most costly option, is to use the 3.0L 16V cylinder head. Again this will require changing to a high temperature exhaust valve which in this case will have to be custom made. You'll also need to custom fabricate intake and exhaust manifolds to match up to the 16V head. On the intake you can take an intake from a 944 S2 or 968, cut the flange off which mates to the cylinder head and weld it onto a 944 Turbo intake manifold. As you might imagine, all this can run up the price tag very quickly. However, the 16V head is capable of a lot more flow than the 8V head so, if you're planning on an extremely high horsepower application and you're willing to spend the bucks, the 16V head is worth consideration. A number of folks have asked me about simply turbocharging a normally aspirated 3.0L engine. Aside from needing to swap to a high temperature exhaust valves, you'll also need to do something to reduce the compression ratio down to a level that is acceptable for a turbocharged engine (ideally less than 8.5:1). This means that you'll also have to swap to a custom made piston. However, there is no one currently making a 3.0L piston that is compatible with the stock alloy bore. Again, you have several options: 1) Have someone make a custom set of pistons and send them out to be specially coated and obtain the proper rings for compatibility, OR 2) Have the block bored and sleeved and obtain a set of custom pistons which do not require coating. So much for displacement increases. Let's move on to something else. Wastegates and Boost Controllers Over time, the spring in the factory wastegate will weaken causing the gate to leak by thus preventing the engine from developing maximum boost. You can replace the factory wastegate with a new wastegate from Porsche. However, a new wastegate is brutally expensive. You can also install shims between the wastegate diaphragm and valve body. This will preload the spring and restore it back close to the original closing force (or greater depending on the number and thickness of shims installed). However, this is really only a band aid fix. Finally, you can replace the wastegate with an aftermarket replacement wastegate. The only problem with aftermarket wastegates is that in most cases they are not a direct bolt-in. The only direct bolt-in replacement (Lindsey Racing) uses a factory wastegate valve body with a different diaphragm (which provides for single or dual-port operation). The Lindsey wastegate requires that you exchange your factory wastegate and that your exchange wastegate be in rebuildable condition. Otherwise a core charge applies. Other wastegates that are being used are Deltas and Tials. The Delta gates are generally less expensive than the Tial wastegates. However, the Tial gates seem to be a lot more reliable. Again, most factory wastegates are not direct bolt-in items. They may require custom flange fabrication and some welding to install. However, some of the performance shops offer packages which include everything to make the aftermarket gate a direct bolt-in. So, when purchasing an aftermarket wastegate, make sure you ask what has to be done to install the gate and if they offer an installation kit. With regards to boost controllers there are basically two types: manual or electronic. Manual boost controllers can be installed under the hood or may be plumbed through the firewall to provide cockpit control. Electronic boost controllers typically have a solenoid valve mounted in the engine compartment to control the opening pressure going to the wastegate. They will have a wiring harness going from the solenoid to the electronic control box which is normally mounted in the passenger's compartment. With regards to advantages and disadvantages, electronic boost controllers are supposed to be more accurate and provide better repeatability at the set boost pressure. I can't confirm or deny that. I'm only repeating what I've heard from others. Manual boost controllers are much less expensive than electronic controllers. Electronic controllers will run in the $350-600 USD price range while a good manual boost controller will run less than $100 USD. Quite honestly, I think manual boost controllers are a lot easier to install and set up as well. I currently have an electronic boost controller and am seriously considering a swap to a manual boost controller. Oiling System 944s have long been notorious for experiencing oiling problems with the #2 rod bearing, particularly during hard cornering. There has been a lot of conjecture over the years as to what exactly causes this problem and most of the reasoning seems plausible. In all likelihood there is no single cause of the problem but, is probably a combination of a number of these factors. One of the factors attributed to the problem is the shear size of the 944 oil pan. It is very large across the bottom and in hard cornering the oil is forced to one side of the pan which can cause the oil pickup tube to become uncovered. Another theory that has been postulated is that windage from the crankshaft and pistons as they rotate inside the engine cause foaming of the oil inside the pan causing the oil pickup tube to become uncovered. Additionally, it has been suggested that the rotation of the pistons up and down cause pressure waves in the oil in the pan which could cause the oil pickup to become uncovered. There are a number of solutions which are being used but, it's not really clear just how effective they are. The simplest and least costly fix is to simply run the oil level at or slight above the high level mark on the dipstick. Most folks say running 1/2 quart high is a good idea especially when running the car on the track. Even if you perform the other modifications for this problem, it's still probably a good idea. One of the primary fixes for this problem is to drill an additional oil passage in the crankshaft rod journal. The simplest way to do this is to simply drill straight through the existing passage to the other side of the crankshaft. This is referred to as &quot;cross-drilling&quot;. Another method is do drill another passage in the rod journal at a 90° angle to the original passage. This is referred to as &quot;perp&quot; (perpendicular) drilling. Of the two, perp drilling is a little more difficult. However, it is also supposed to be more effective. I can't comment one way or the other on that. Another modifications for the problem is to rebaffle the oil pan. Most places will charge you upwards of $250 for this modifications including exchanging your old pan. However, this modification is something that a good machinist can do for you much cheaper. Part of the modification involves installing a barn door on one side of the pan. It consists of a piano hinge and a piece of sheet aluminum to form the door. The door is mounted to swing out toward the center of the pan such that in a hard corner the door closes to impede the flow of oil the large open area on that side of the pan. The door is fabricated such that when it is closed there is a small gap between the door and the bottom of pan. The other modification is made to the oil pickup tube. At the bottom of the tube is a screen to prevent debris from being picked up by the oil pump. The screen has almost a half moon shape to it which means that the actual pickup point is close to 1&quot; off the bottom of the pan. The modification involve welding a metal band around the circumference of the screen about 3/4&quot; wide which effective lowers the pickup point. Another modification used to alleviate this problem is to drill passages in the main bearing saddles. This is supposed to allow free air flow between the saddles thus reducing the pressure wave effect caused by the pistons moving up and down. On modification that has been used for years in other engine applications is to knife-edge the crankshaft. This acts to reduce foaming of oil in the pan. The last modification I'm aware of for this problem is the installation of an Accusump system. This system consists of a canister with a pressurized volume of oil. If a loss of oil pressure is sensed, the system will provide pressurized oil to the bearings. Many of the owners I've talked to who have this system feel like it is a waste of money and that the delay time associated with the oil being supplied to the bearings is too great to provide adequate protection. Crankshaft and Flywheel If you reduce the rotating mass of the engine, it will spin up much more quickly. One of the things you can do to accomplish this is to lighten the crankshaft. I've known of places that take as much as 17 lbs. off of the crankshaft. However, when you take too much weight off the crankshaft the engine has a tendency to stall when it is running and drops back to an idle condition. I don't recommend reducing the crankshaft weight by more than 10 lbs. As we mentioned in the previous section, knife-edging the crankshaft is used to prevent foaming the oil in the pan. However, it has the additional advantage of reducing the rotating mass and reducing the windage losses inside the engine. Another method of reducing the engine's rotating mass is to use a lighter flywheel. This can be done by machining the factory flywheel to reduce the weight or by using an aluminum flywheel. Lightening a factory flywheel will normally run around $200 USD while an aluminum flywheel will normally cost $500-600 USD. Cat Bypass Pipes Let's start off with an obligatory disclaimer. Strictly speaking cat bypass pipes are illegal from an emissions standpoint. They should only be used for &quot;track only&quot; cars that are not registered for street use. However, I can tell you that a cat bypass pipe will provide a noticeable improvement in performance. By reducing the backpressure on the discharge of the turbocharger, it reduces the turbo spool up time and thus the turbo lag. Summary There are a number of other modifications related to engine performance available. They range from improved intake manifolds, cylinder heads with larger intake and exhaust valves, larger exhaust systems, better flowing intercooler pipes, and bigger intercoolers. As I have more time to work on this document down the road I will probably address more of these. Bottom line is you can spend about as much money on performance modifications as your wallet will allow. Choose them wisely. Drive it like you stole it.");sQ1[86]=new Array("shop-manual/eng-17.htm","Engine Oil and Filter Change","","ENG-17, Engine Oil and Filter Change Acrobat Printable Version Introduction Porsche recommends replacing the oil and filter every 7500 miles for turbocharged cars and every 15000 miles for normally aspirated cars. This is one of the few times I feel that Porsche erred in the non-conservative direction with regards to a maintenance interval. Frequent oil changes are vital to the longevity of a car's engine. Consequently, I change the oil and filter in my own car's religiously every 3000 miles. I don't recommend allowing a car to go more than 5000 miles between oil changes. Regardless of how often you decide to change your oil, pick a replacement interval and stick to it. You'll see better long-term performance from you car's engine. Tools 17 mm socket and ratchet OR 17 mm combination wrench Type J Oil Filter Wrench Jack Stands and Floor Jack OR Ramps Drain Pan Catch Rags Parts Mahle OC 142 * Oil Filter OR Porsche OEM Filter (944 107 201 90) Oil Approximately 5.5 liters (5.8 US quarts) filled to the upper dipstick mark Oil Drain Plug Seal Ring (26 x 32 mm - 900 123 049 30) * You may also use the Mahle OC 75 Oil Filter which is a taller version of the OC 142. This filter was used on some 911 Turbo models. If you happen to lose or damage the Oil Pan Drain Plug the Porsche part number is N 016 164 1. It is an M20 x 1.5 plug and you may be able to find it at an Auto Pats Store without having to buy it from Porsche. Procedure Run the vehicle for a few minutes to warm the engine oil before remove. With the oil warm it tends to flow better and thus remove more sludge / deposits from the engine. Raise the front of the vehicle on jack stands or ramps. NOTE All 944s came from the factory with two skid pans. One covered the front-bottom part of the engine compartment (below the accessory belts). The other covered the bottom-rear part of the engine compartment (below the oil pan). To do an oil change, the rear skid pan had to be removed to access the oil pan drain plug. On most 944s, this rear skid pan has long since been discarded. Most 944 owners found it much easier to change the oil if they didn't have to remove that pan every time. Also, the engine tends to run a bit cooler as there is more air flow across the oil pan and hence better oil cooling. Again, most 944s don't have this pan anymore but, you may find that your 944 has this pan in place. It will have to be removed to change the oil. Some folks will tell you that the oil filter will not make as bit a mess if you punch a hole in the top of the filter before you remove it. Other folks will tell you it makes no difference. And, some folks will tell you it makes an even bigger mess. Anyway, if you decide to try this, punch a hole in the top-center portion of the filter before removing the oil pan drain plug. The oil flowing out of the pan will help draw the oil out of the filter and make this method more effective. Place a catch pan underneath the oil pan below the oil pan drain plug. Using a 17 mm socket and ratchet or 17 mm combination wrench, remove the oil pan drain plug. After the oil has drained for a few minutes, remove the oil fill cap. If you didn't punch a hole in the oil filter to help it drain, you can remove the oil fill cap prior to removing the oil pan drain plug. Inspect the oil pan drain plug seal ring. If it has scratches or gouges, or if it is deformed at all, replace it. When the engine oil has completely drained, replace the drain plug with seal ring and torque to 50 Nm (37 ft-lbs.). Move the the drain pan underneath the oil filter area. Stuff as many catch rags as possible around an below the oil filter. Using an appropriate oil filter wrench, remove the oil filter. Apply a coating of new engine oil to the seal ring on the new oil filter. This prevents tearing the seal during installation and also makes removal of the filter easier in the future when you have to replace it. Install the new filter hand tight. Most manufacturers don't recommend using a filter wrench to torque a filter on during installation. You can but, don't turn the filter more than 1/4 turn past hand tight. Fill the engine with new oil and check the dipstick level prior to starting the engine. Fill to at least the high mark as some of the oil will be pumped up into the oil filter and remain there when the engine is started. Start the engine and check for normal oil pressure. Remove the car from ramps or jack stands. If jack stands were used stop the engine before removing the car from the jack stands. Stop the engine and allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes to allow all the oil to drain back to the pan. With the car sitting on level ground, check the engine oil level again and top off as necessary. Take the used oil to an approved disposal facility.

That means that the steering rack and engine cross-member should already be removed from the car. For manual transmission cars, if the clutch disc and/or pressure plate was removed while the engine was out of the car, ensure that the clutch disc has been aligned with the pressure plate prior to attempting to install the engine. Actually, the should have been done prior to installing the engine's bell housing. You can obtain a clutch alignment tool from Baum Tool. However, a universal clutch alignment tool which can be obtained at most major auto parts stores will work just as well. Ensure that the motor mount brackets are attached to the engine block. Ensure that the car is raised high enough to slide the engine underneath. Position the engine under the car in the center of the engine compartment. Attach an engine hoist or chain hoist to the engine's lifting points (2 - one at the back of the cam housing, one near the alternator). Raise the engine into position in the car. The engine will have to be move toward the front of the engine compartment to clear the front end of the drive shaft. When the end of the drive shaft is positioned in the center of the opening in the clutch housing, slide the hoist toward the rear of the car. The engine may have to be rocked slightly as it is moved back onto the drive shaft. However, if the clutch disc is aligned properly, the drive shaft should insert without a great deal of effort. Install the torque tube (central tube) flange to clutch housing bolts (4, M10 x 35mm). Torque bolts to 42 Nm (30 ft-lbs). Note Prior to installing the cross-member, check the motor mounts using ENG-11, to see if they need to be replaced. Ensure the engine motor mounts are installed into the cross-member. Install the lower motor mount bolts (10 mm) but, do not fully tighten until the cross-member is raised into place. NOTE If new motor mounts have been installed, use ENG-12 to determine the correct length of upper motor mount bolts (4 - 8mm bolts) to be used. Using a floor jack, raise the cross-member into position under the engine. Check to make sure that the motor mounts line up with the motor mount brackets on the engine block. You'll probably find it easiest to slide the steering shaft universal joint on to the spline inlet shaft of the steering rack before the cross-member is fully raised into position. Be sure to install the universal joint in the correct orientation as marked on the input shaft splines and universal joint during removal. Install the universal joint locking bolt. Install the upper motor mount bolts (8mm) and using a 13 mm socket torque to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). Using a 17 mm socket, torque the lower motor mount bolts to 32 ft-lbs. When the cross-member is fully raised into position, install the cross-member mounting bolts (12 mm) and using a 19 mm socket, torque to 85 Nm (63 ft-lbs). Disconnect the engine hoist and move the hoist and floor jack out of the way. Install the suspension control arms and stabilizer bar. Torque the control arm to cross-member lock nut (12 mm) to 48 ft-lbs. Torque the rear control arm mounting bracket bolts (10 mm) to 34 ft-lbs. This is the assembly for the eccentric caster bolt at the rear of the control arm. Attach the steering knuckle to the control arm ball joint. Torque the steering knuckle lock nut (10 mm) to 37 ft-lbs. Bolt the air condition compressor into place. Install the front stabilizer bar. Torque the stabilizer to control arm lock nut (10 mm) to 18 ft-lbs. Torque the stabilizer bracket to body bolts (8 mm) to 17 ft-lbs. Install the alternator, if removed. Install motor mount heat shield. Install slave cylinder. Install the exhaust system. If equipped, install the oxygen sensor (USA cars) Attach fuel supply and return lines. Install the charcoal venting hose. Install the AC fast idle hose. Install all vacuum and coolant hoses. Reattach the hose to the heater control valve and the hose for the coolant return line from the heater core. Install the power steering pump and reconnect hoses. Install the starter and reconnect electrical leads. Route the engine wiring harness through the firewall to the DME control unit. Reconnect all engine grounds. There should be a connection near the top of the clutch housing on the driver's side of the vehicle (RHD) and a connection on the block near the same location. There should also be a ground connection on the firewall either inside the engine compartment or inside the battery compartment. BE SURE TO CLEAN ALL GROUND CONNECTIONS THOROUGHLY BEFORE INSTALLATION. A bad ground connection can result in poor running and may lead to eventual failure of the DME control unit. Connect the brake booster vacuum hose. Connect the throttle cable and, if equipped, the cruise control cable and cruise control unit servo electrical connector. Install the radiator using COOL-04. On turbocharged cars install the turbocharger cooling pump, connect hoses, and electrical connector. Install the rotor and distributor cap using IGN-01. Install the air flow sensor and air filter housing using AF-01. Attach the engine wiring harness to the firewall using appropriate cable ties. Inside car, connect the wiring harness to the DME control unit (and KLR on turbo models). Using COOL-02, fill and vent the coolant system. Fill the power steering reservoir. Check the engine oil for proper level. Connect the battery leads. Install the fuse for the fuel pump, if removed. Start vehicle and allow to warm up. Check for leaks in the engine compartment and underneath the vehicle. Move steering wheel from side to side and check level in power steering reservoir. Add fluid as necessary.

Attempt to start the vehicle. The vehicle may start but should immediately stall as the fuel system depressurizes. Disconnect the battery as follows: Disconnect the battery ground cable and then the battery positive cable. Push the positive cable through the hole in the firewall and into the engine compartment. (Removing the battery will make getting the cable through the firewall much easier) If equipped with cruise control, disconnect the electrical connector at the cruise control servo unit near the passenger's side strut tower. Using DME-01, disconnect the DME Control Unit. On turbo models, also disconnect the KLR Control Unit. Release/cut tie wraps (depending on type) at the firewall to get the battery cable out of the way of the DME wire bundle. Pull the DME control unit plug through the opening in the firewall and into the engine compartment. (There may be several other cable connectors near the DME that have wires running in the DME wire bundle which will have to be disconnected to get the wire bundle through the firewall. Ensure all wires are disconnected before attempting to pull the bundle through the firewall). Using AF-01, remove the air filter housing and the air flow sensor assembly. On turbo model, remove the throttle body inlet line from the intercooler, and the rubber inlet plenum boot. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap, rotor, and dust cap. Loosen the lug nuts on the wheels enough to allow them to be removed easily once the car is raised. (One or two turns is more than enough) Place the vehicle on jack stands. The engine is removed from underneath the vehicle so at least 21 inches of clearance is required. Raising the vehicle to a lower height initially will simplify any work done from above. The vehicle can then be raised to obtain clearance just prior to removing the front cross-member. Remove the front wheels. From underneath the car, remove all skid/belly pans which protects the bottom of the engine. On models which have the &quot;turbo&quot; aerodynamics package, you will need to remove the skid pan under the nose panel as well. NOTE: Many of the cars that have been around for a while have had the back belly pan removed and left off for easier access to the oil drain plug. Using COOL-04, remove the radiator from the car. On turbocharged cars perform the following: Loosen and remove the hose from the coolant expansion tank to the turbocharger and the hose to the turbocharger pump suction. Loosen the hose on the turbocharger pump discharge , disconnect the pump electrical connector, and remove the pump and mounting bracket from the car. NOTE Clean as much debris from the radiator coils as you can while you have it out of the car. You may also want to have the radiator inspected/tested by your local radiator shop while it is out of the car. It's also a good time to install new radiator hoses and a lower temperature thermofan switch if you've been considering either. Unplug all wiring harness connectors at the firewall and finishing releasing/cutting any cable ties attaching the harness to the firewall. Disconnect the throttle cable. If equipped with cruise control, disconnect the cruise control cable as well. Disconnect the brake booster vacuum hose. Disconnect the engine ground cables at the firewall. In the engine compartment, disconnect the starter wiring connector. Remove the starter from the vehicle. Disconnect the hoses from the power steering pump and remove the pump. Remove the clutch slave cylinder bracket bolts. Mark all hoses which must be removed from the car for ease of installation. Remove the coolant hose on the heater valve. Remove the coolant return heater hose at the rear of the cylinder head. If not already done, remove the coolant feed hoses on the expansion tank. Remove the vacuum lines to the vent valve and the thermo valve at the back of the engine. Remove the A/C fast idle hose. Remove the charcoal venting hose. Disconnect the fuel supply and return lines. The fuel system should be depressurized but, a small amount of fuel may leak from the fuel rail or the fuel lines when disconnected. Hose clamps or locking pliers can be used as an additional measure to prevent leakage. If you decide not to use clamps, have some rags handy to catch any leaking fuel. Attach an engine hoist to the lifting rings mounted on the engine. If equipped with an oxygen sensor (USA cars), disconnect the O2 sensor wire at the fire wall and remove the O2 sensor from the exhaust. Remove the exhaust system. Unbolt the slave cylinder and move it out of the way, leaving the fluid lines attached. Remove the right side motor mount shield. Remove the alternator. This step is called for the in the factory manual. However, the engine can be removed with the alternator installed. Remove the front stabilizer bar assembly-to-chassis (drop link) bolts and control arm bolts and remove the stabilizer from the vehicle. Unbolt the air conditioning compressor, with lines intact, and hang it from the front strut spring. Remove the bolts that attach the torque tube to the clutch housing. Disconnect the steering tie rod ends. Place alignment marks on the splined input shaft on the steering rack and the universal joint on the steering shaft so they can be assembled in the same orientation on installation. ( A punch and hammer or brightly colored finger nail polish will work fine.) Disconnect the steering gear shaft using a punch and hammer. Be careful not to damage the splines on the steering shaft. Remove the bolts that attach the suspension control arm to the chassis. Disconnect the suspension ball joints on the control arm. Remove the motor mount nuts and bolts. Support the cross member using a floor jack and a piece of wood. With the engine supported by the engine hoist above, remove the cross member bolts. Disconnect the cross member with the steering rack and stabilizer bar attached and lower it from the vehicle. Lower the engine from the car, moving it forward to disengage the drive shaft splines from the engine as it is lowered. Lowering the engine on to a piece of carpet or cardboard will make it easier to slide the engine out from underneath the car. Disconnect the hoist from the engine and slide the engine out from underneath the car. Attach the hoist to the engine and move the engine to a suitable place to be worked on.

This is especially true if you aren't aware if all the possible causes of a problem. This is a general guide which will list symptoms for 944 starting and running problems and common causes of those problems. It is intended to help you map out a troubleshooting plan. Running Problems Rough Idle If the car starts when cold but, idles rough or does not want to stay running, this can indicate a problem with the engine temperature sensor. When the engine is started cold, the engine temperature sensor sends a signal to the DME control unit to provide a richer mixture. As the engine temperature sensor starts to fail, it sends a higher than actual temperature signal to the DME control unit. The DME control unit leans the fuel mixture thinking the engine is at normal operating temperature. This causes the engine to run rough. As the engine warms, it not longer needs the richer cold idle mixture and the engine runs smoother. If the car idles rough this can also be indicative of bad plug wires, distributor, or rotor. One way to check for bad plug wires is to inspect the plug wire runs with the car running in a very dark area. If the plug wires are bad you should see some arching to the cylinder head or fuel rail. If the car idles rough or cuts off at low RPM or idle, the cause could be a failing O2 sensor. The O2 sensor is out of the loop at full throttle and will not affect the way the car runs. A rough idle can also be caused by a problem with the air flow box. The damper for the air flow box can fail mechanically or the contacts inside the box can get dirty and send a errant signal to the DME control unit. This can sometimes be corrected by cleaning the electrical contacts inside the air box. This requires removing the cover on the air box which is held in place by caulk. You will need to cut through the caulk and gently pry the cover off. Once the cover is removed, clean the circuit board inside with a good contact cleaner. When you have finished cleaning the circuit board, reattach the cover using a non-corrosive caulk. If the car experiences a rough idle or idle fluctuates several hundred RPM, this can indicate a sticking idle stabilizer valve. Many people have removed and cleaned them but, this is normally a temporary fix and the valve should be replaced. A faulty O2 sensor can also cause RPM to fluctuate at idle. Unplug the O2 sensor and see if the idle still fluctuates. Difficult Starting If the car is difficult to crank after sitting for more than several hours, the fuel return regulator or fuel pump check valve could be faulty. This will allow the fuel rail to depressurize and it takes some time for the fuel pump to increase fuel rail pressure sufficiently to fire the car. If the car is difficult to start when warm, again the fuel pump check valve, fuel return regulator, or individual fuel injectors could be leaking. The fuel pump check valve or the fuel return regulator leaking allows the fuel to drain back to the gas tank depressurizing the fuel rail. When the car is warm, the fuel remaining in the fuel rail can flash causing vapor lock. There are several ways to check this. One is to connect a fuel pressure gauge at the fuel rail. Start the car, let it run until fuel pressure is stable, then shut down the car and monitor the pressure at the fuel rail. With the car not running, the pressure at the fuel rail should not decrease to less than 15 psig. If it starts to decrease, clamp the rubber part of the line from the fuel return regulator to the gas tank and see if it stops the pressure decrease. If not, clamp the line at the discharge of the fuel pump and see if it stops the pressure decrease. An individual fuel injector leaking can depressurize the fuel rail and cause the same problem. If the car starts easily when cold, but is difficult to start when warm a failing DME relay could be causing the problem. As the DME relay starts to fail, it operates at a higher temperature. If the car is stopped, the higher temperature of the relay creates a high enough resistance to keep the relay from picking up when the car is started again. When the relay cools and the resistance decreases, the relay will again function normally. If the car is very hard to start or only fires part of the time and then dies it could be a problem with the distributor cap or rotor. 944 rotors are notorious for having the set screw back out of the rotor allowing it to spin on the end of the camshaft. When this happens the car will not fire at all or will fire momentarily when the rotor is in line with the correct cylinder to be fired. If the car is difficult to start when cold it could be a problem with the engine speed or reference sensors. One of the sensors sends a signal to the DME for TDC and the other an engine speed signal. The DME uses these signals to time the pulses to the ignition coil and the firing of the fuel injectors. If the sensors do not send the proper signal to the DME the normal result is a failure to get proper spark from the ignition coil. Sometimes their failure may be a result of debris building up on the ends of the sensors which reduces the gap between the sensor and the flywheel. If so, cleaning the ends of the sensor may get them working again. If the car is difficult to start or will not start at all regardless of operating temperature, there are a number of problems which could be causing this. Here is a list of possible causes: DME Control Unit DME Relay Security System Control Unit Fuel Pump Fuel Pump Fuse Distributor Cap, Rotor, Coil, or Primary Coil Wire Engine Speed and/or Reference Sensors A fuel pressure gauge, spark tester, and voltmeter are extremely useful in narrowing down the possible causes of the problem.

Support the exhaust with blocks or jack stands. Remove the nuts and bolts on the hanger in front of the catalytic converter, the rear of the catalytic converter, and at the rear of the muffler. Lower the exhaust system from the car. Cross-Over Pipe Removal (Turbo) Remove the intake manifold using FUEL-09. Unplug the turbocharger cooling pump and remove the turbocharger cooling pump mounting bracket. Place some rags under the hose on the discharge of the turbocharger cooling pump going to the turbocharger. Loosen the hose clamp on the 90° bend cooling water supply pipe to the turbocharger. Slide the hose (still attached to the cooling pump) off of the pipe and move out of the way toward the front of the car. Some coolant will come out of the turbocharger cooling jacket. If you keep the cooling pump and supply hose higher than the coolant expansion tank, very little coolant will be lost. Using a 22 mm wrench and a 27 mm wrench, remove the 90° bend cooling water supply pipe and the threaded nipple on the jacket water supply to the turbocharger. From above, remove the two turbocharger inlet flange nuts and bolts at the top of the flange and the nut and bolt on the bottom of the flange nearest the front of the car. These require two 15 mm wrenches or a wrench and 15 mm socket. From above, disconnect the O2 sensor electrical connector (round connector on the mounting bracket at the back of the intake manifold). From under the car, remove the O2 sensor. Remove the turbocharger inlet flange bolt on the bottom of the flange nearest the back of the car. This requires a 15 mm wrench or socket. However, no wrench is need for the nut as it is tack welded to the flange. Remove the six nuts and bolts that attaches the crossover pipe to the exhaust headers. For models with a two-piece crossover pipe, remove the nuts and bolts on the triangle shaped flange between the crossover pipe and the wastegate. For cars with a one-piece crossover pipe it will be necessary to remove the wastegate to remove the crossover pipe. Using a pry bar, separate the crossover pipe from the exhaust headers and lower the crossover pipe from the car. Exhaust Manifold Removal Remove the six nuts and bolts on the flanges between the exhaust manifolds and the exhaust pipe (crossover pipe on Turbo models). Remove the two Allen head bolts that attach the coolant return pipe to the cam housing. NOTE It may be necessary to remove the coolant return pipe completely to get the exhaust headers out. This will require partially draining the coolant system. To remove the exhaust manifolds it is necessary to remove the exhaust manifold studs. To do this, loosen the exhaust nut several turns and then install a second nut onto the stud. Tighten the outside nut against the inside nut while holding the inside nut with a wrench to prevent it from turning. Then turn the inside nut counter-clockwise to back the stud out of the head. If the nuts turn on the stud, the outside nut needs to be tightened. Remove the exhaust manifolds from the car. Installation There are very few instances when I invoke the standard &quot;installation is the reverse of removal&quot;. However, this is one of those rare cases. I do recommend using new hardware when installing the exhaust system. Also, for turbocharged cars with one piece cross-over pipes, remember to fill and vent the cooling system (COOL-02).

Bosch claims that all their spec information is proprietary and only released to manufacturers who purchase injectors for a specific application. Also, the information provided below lists the rated injector flows at a specific test pressure. Normally, Bosch injectors are tested at 3 bar. However, in some cases they are tested at 2.5 bar or 2.7 bar. Realize that in our applications, the injectors probably don't operate at the test pressure list and the injectors may flow more or less than the rated flow depending on the pressure at which the system actually operates. For 944s and 968s, all 8V cars use a 2.5 bar fuel pressure regulator while the 16V cars use a 3.8 bar fuel pressure regulator.

Our discussion here will focus on isolating the cause of fuel level indicating problems and what needs to be done to fix the problem.

Remove the fuel sender cover. The cover will likely be covered with an insulation pad. Disconnect the electrical connector from the top of the fuel level sender. Using the Multimeter and variable potentiometer, set the potentiometer to one of the resistances in the appropriate table for your car. Connect the potentiometer between Terminals 1 and 3 on the connector. On some cars, Terminal 1 may be labeled &quot;G&quot; and Terminal 3 may be labeled &quot;31&quot; or &quot;T&quot;. Make sure that no wires touch a point on the body or fuel tank where they could become grounded. Turn the ignition to the &quot;ON&quot; position. Check the indication of the fuel level gauge. The level should indicate approximately the level from the table for the installed resistance.. Turn the ignition to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Remove the installed resistance. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for several resistances across the full range of indication. Results If the indications on the fuel level gauge do not agree with those list above, the wiring from the sender to the gauge or the gauge itself is the problem. If you suspect that there is a problem with the gauge portion of the circuit, first try cleaning the fuel sender grounds. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), the fuel sender grounding point is in the rear hatch area near the left rear light. On late model 944s, the fuel level sender grounding point is on the inside of the firewall on the driver's side of the vehicle (LHD). You may also try cleaning the electrical connections at the gauge. On newer model cars with instrument clusters, remove the gauge package (ELECT-07) and clean the ribbon connectors on the back of the gauge package with a pencil eraser. On early model cars, remove the gauges using ELECT-06. Clean the contacts for the fuel level gauge and replace the instrument cluster. If the original test results indicated a problem with the gauge or gauge wiring and the problems persist after cleaning the grounding points and gauge connections, you may want to send the fuel pressure gauge (early cars) or the gauge cluster (later cars) to an authorized repair facility to be checked. I recommend sending the gauges to North Hollywood Speedometer or you can contact VDO to find an authorized repair facility near you. North Hollywood Speedometer 6111 Lankershim Blvd. North Hollywood, CA 91606 818-761-5136 http://www.nhspeedometer.com Siemens VDO Automotive 188 Brooke Rd. Winchester, VA 22603 540-665-0110 At one time, you could send gauges directly to VDO for repair. Apparently, you now have to go through one of their authorized repair facilities (i.e. NHS is an authorized repair facility). Fuel Level Sender If results from the test of the fuel level gauge indicate that the gauge is working properly, the cause of the problem is most likely the fuel level sender. Quite often the fuel level sender can become gummed up and a good cleaning may correct the problem. Start by removing the fuel level sender from the tank. To do this you'll need to disconnect the electrical connector for the sending unit. Next, disconnect the two fuel lines on top of tank. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the black plastic locking ring counter-clockwise to remove. On pre-1985.5 cars, remove the five cheesehead screws that hold the sender to the top of the fuel tank. Lift the fuel sending unit out of the top of the fuel tank. Thoroughly clean the sender float and slide mechanism using a good engine de-greaser or carburetor and choke cleaner and a brush. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 1 and 3 on the sender. With the float all the way down, the resistance should read approximately RESERVE resistance (see table above for specific resistance for your model year). Slowly move the float up while watching the resistance reading. As you move the float up, the resistance should slowly decrease to approximately 3 ohms with the float all the way up. The decrease in resistance should be fairly linear and smooth. If you notice any erratic changes in resistance, then the sender is bad or needs additional cleaning. If satisfactory resistance readings can not be obtained, the sender should be replaced.

Be careful when removing fuel rail end cap as the fuel rail may be under high pressure. Remove the cap from the end of the fuel rail (8V cars). There is a sealing ball (essentially a ball bearing) in the end of the fuel rail. Be sure to catch the sealing ball when removing the cap. On 16V cars, the cap is on the side of the fuel rail closest to the intake manifold between intake runners 1 and 2. Attach the fuel pressure gauge to the end of the fuel rail. With most gauges you'll need some type of adapter to attach the gauge. The more expensive fuel pressure gauge kits will include metric adapters. I fabricated my own adapter using an old fuel rail end cap which I drilled and tapped to accept an adapter (Pipe thread to SAE thread) which would work with my Craftsman 0-100 psi fuel pressure gauge. On early (pre-1985.5) cars remove the fuel pump relay located on the relay/fuse panel under the dash on the driver's side (left-hand drive). On late model cars, remove the DME relay located on the relay/fuse panel under the hood. On the panel where the relay was removed, jumper terminals 30 and 87b. If unsure about the terminal numbers, look at the terminal labeling on the bottom side of the relay. When the jumper is installed the fuel pump should start. Check fuel pressure gauge reading against the &quot;Engine Stopped - Relay Jumpered&quot; values in the fuel pressure specification table for your vehicle. Remove the jumper, install relay, and start engine. Check the fuel pressure gauge reading against the &quot;Engine Running at Idle&quot; value in the fuel pressure specification table for you vehicle. Values which are significantly higher than the specification values typically indicate a problem with the fuel pressure regulator. Values significantly below the specification values typically indicate a problem with the fuel pump or a clogged fuel filter. After the engine has been run at idle, stop the engine and allow the car to sit for 20 minutes to check the fuel system leakdown. After 20 minutes, check the fuel pressure gauge reading against the &quot;20 Minute Leakdown&quot; values the the fuel pressure specification table. Values significantly below the specification value are typically the result of a bad check valve (supply side of fuel pump). NOTE Have rags ready to catch any fuel which might escape from the fuel rail when the end cap is removed. Be careful when removing fuel rail end cap as the fuel rail may be under high pressure. When all testing is complete, remove the fuel pressure gauge from the fuel rail. Replace the sealing ball and end cap on the end of the fuel rail. Tighten cap to 22 Nm (16 ft-lb).

The first choice is to buy a fuel pressure gauge with metric fittings and metric adapters. However, these are typically very expensive and if you own other cars that are made in the USA, you won't be able to use the fuel pressure gauge on them. The second choice is to buy a cheap 0-100 fuel pressure gauge which is made to check the fuel pressure on cars made in the US. However, you'll have to make a Metric-to-SAE adapter to be able to use it. The procedure that follows will describe two methods of making an adapter to use an SAE thread fuel pressure gauge. Most fuel pressure gauges made for US cars use a female 1/4&quot; flare fitting for the gauge. So, this procedure is written assuming that your particular gauge has that fitting. If you find that your pressure gauge has some other size fitting, you'll have to adjust the procedure accordingly. Tools and Materials NOTE When you are looking for a brass fitting, you may find it easier to locate a 1/4&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; flare fitting. If so, you'll need a 1/4&quot; NPT tap instead of a 1/8&quot; NPT tap. The reason I chose the 1/8&quot; NPT fitting is that when you're drill half way through each side of the adapter and then threading it, it's easier to see the transition from one type of thread to the other with the 1/8&quot; NPT thread on one side. 1 Piece of Round Stock, Aluminum or Mild Steel, 7/8&quot; to 1&quot; diameter (minimum 7/8&quot;), approximately 1&quot; long (Option 2) 1/8&quot; NPT Tap (Option 1 and 2) 12 mm x 1.5 Tap (Option 2) Brass male-to-male fitting (1/8&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; flare) (Option 2) Spare fuel rail cap nut, Porsche P/N 928 110 475 01 (Option 1) Teflon thread tape (Option 1 and 2) Option 1 Obtain a spare fuel rail cap nut. You can get one from numerous aftermarket parts vendors for less than $5 USD. Drill and tap a 1/8&quot; NPT thread hole in the center of the cap. Apply teflon thread tape to the brass male-to-male fitting and thread into cap nut. Option 2 Center punch an indent in the middle of the round stock and drill a small pilot hole all the way through. From one end drill about half way through the piece of round stock using a 10 mm or 13/32&quot; drill bit. Thread the opening just drilled with a 12 mm x 1.5 pitch tap. From the other end drill about half way through using an 11/32&quot; drill bit. Thread the opening just drilled with a 1/8&quot; NPT thread tap. Go to a plumbing supply store and get a 1/8&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; flare (male-to-male) fitting and thread into adapter. You may also want to cut flats on each side of the adapter so you can turn it with a wrench. I cut mind to accept a 17 mm wrench.

However, it's quite understandable as faulty FPRs can display a wide range of symptoms depending on how the regulator fails. Also, the function and location of the FPR is quite often confused with the fuel damper. The fuel damper is on the supply to the fuel rail and functions to &quot;dampen&quot; the pulsations caused by the fuel injectors. The fuel pressure regulator is located on the return to the fuel tank and functions to control the pressure on the fuel rail.

If you have access to a 0-100 psi fuel pressure gauge , check the fuel pressure at the rail using FUEL-01. Normally a faulty fuel pressure regulator will result in a very high fuel pressure. So, if your fuel pressure is well above the specs provided in FUEL-01, you probably have a bad FPR. One of the most common failure modes for the FPR is to fail closed to the point that fuel rail pressure is extremely high. The high differential pressure across the injectors causes them to draw excessive current. The excessive current is seen by the injector drivers which subsequently shutdown. If you have a condition where the car will not start or starts and almost immediately dies, try disconnecting the wire for one (1) injector. Attempt to start the engine. If it starts and continues to run, the fuel pressure regulator is likely bad. Bear in mind that running on only three cylinders, the car will run very rough. By disconnecting one injector, it reduces the current enough to keep the injector drivers from shutting down. Replacement Disconnect the fuel pressure regulator vacuum line. Place a catch rag under the regulator fuel line connection. Disconnect the fuel line from the fuel pressure regulator. Normally this will be a hose clamp that can be removed by either a flat tip or Phillips head screwdriver. CAUTION Use caution when removing the fuel pressure regulator from the fuel rail as the rail may be under pressure and can spray into your face and eyes. It's a good idea to wear safety glasses while removing the regulator as well as covering the regulator with a rag. Remove the fuel pressure regulator retaining bolts. (normally 10 mm socket) Rock the regulator back and forth gently until it is free from the fuel rail. Install the new regulator in the fuel rail, install and tighten the retaining bolts. Connect the fuel line to the regulator. Connect the vacuum line to the regulator.

Slowly disconnect the return line from the fuel pressure regulator (FPR) going back to the fuel tank. Using a hose clamp attach a hose to the discharge of the FPR that is long enough to reach the measuring container. On early cars (pre-1985.5), remove the fuel pump relay (located under the dash on the driver's side (left-hand drive)). On late model cars, remove the DME relay located on the fuse / relay panel under the hood. NOTE Be prepared to start the timing device as the fuel pump will start as soon as the jumper is installed. On the panel where the relay was removed (early or late model), jumper terminals 30 and 87b. The fuel pump should start. Start the stopwatch as soon as you hear the pump start running.

If you have a fuel pump that needs to be replaced, there is likely something else that has caused the fuel pump to fail. So, before you simply replace the fuel, you may want to see if there is another problem that caused the fuel pump to fail. A clogged fuel filter can cause failure of the fuel pump. A failing fuel pressure regulator can also result in pump failure. It's a good idea when installing a new pump to perform a fuel pressure check and pump delivery rate check. This will check the condition of the entire fuel system and may prevent pre-mature failure of the new pump by identifying potential system problems. Tools Metric wrench / socket set Catch Rags Hose clamp pliers or locking pliers Jack stands and floor jack OR ramps Removal Depressurize the fuel system as follows: Remove the fuel pump fuse. On 1985.5 and newer cars the fuel pump should be supplied via the DME relay through Fuse 34 (15A) on the Central Electric Panel under the hood. On pre-1985.5 cars, the fuel pump is supplied via Fuse 2 on the Auxiliary Fuse Panel (under dash driver's side - LHD). Attempt to start the engine. It may or may not start. If it does start, allow it to run until it stops due to lack of fuel. Disconnect the battery negative lead. Raise the rear of the vehicle by placing it on jack stands or ramps. If the vehicle is equipped with a cover for the fuel pump (at the bottom of the fuel tank) remove the fuel pump cover. The cover will have a strap holding it to the bottom of the fuel tank and a single bolt (13 mm head) near the wheel well. Disconnect the electrical leads from the fuel pump. Depending on the model of the vehicle, you may have to disconnect the lead from the pump or there may be a two prong plug connector near the pump that may simply be unplugged. Using hose clamp pliers or locking pliers, clamp off the line from the fuel tank to the suction of the fuel pump. If regular locking pliers are used, it's a good idea to wrap the fuel line to keep the teeth on the locking pliers from damaging the fuel line. Fuel Pump Electrical Plug Loosen the hose clamp on the fuel pump suction line and disconnect the line from the pump. Have some catch rags and a pan ready to catch any residual fuel which will drain from the line. Using the appropriate size wrenches, disconnect the discharge line from the fuel pump. Loosen the hose clamp holding the fuel pump and slide the pump out of the holder. Installation Prior to installation of the new fuel pump, compare the fittings to make sure the new pump has all the correct fittings. If all the correct fittings have not been supplied with the new pump, transfer fitting from the old pump to the new as necessary. Slide the new fuel pump into the fuel pump holder. Tighten the clamp that holds the fuel pump in place. Do not over tighten the clamp as it can damage the fuel pump motor. Attach the suction line and discharge line to the new fuel pump. Remove the hose clamp from the pump suction line. Connect the electrical leads to the fuel pump. Connect the battery negative lead. Install the fuel pump fuse (see Removal section for fuse location). Start the vehicle to check for proper operation of the fuel pump and to check for fuel system leaks. If equipped with a fuel pump cover, install the cover. Remove the vehicle from jack stands or ramps.

Now, most people realize that there is a fuel filter on the discharge side of the fuel pump. However, most people are unaware that there is also a strainer on the suction side of the pump. The strainer is part of the fuel tank outlet line and requires draining the fuel tank to clean or replace the strainer. So, is you have a low fuel system pressure as measured at the fuel rail or are experiencing a low fuel pump capacity, before you replace the pump, first try replacing the fuel filter. Next, try cleaning the fuel pump suction strainer. Then, if neither of those fixes the problem, it's time to consider replacing the fuel pump. Also, I've seen instances where leaks at the fuel tank resulted from a failed seal for the fuel pump suction strainer. If you have a leak in the location of the strainer, drain the fuel tank, remove the strainer, and replace the seal using the appropriate steps of this procedure.

If your fuel level gauge is not working or you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, assume that the tank is full and have enough contains on hand to drain approximately 20 gallons of fuel from the tank. Disconnect the battery negative lead. Raise the rear of the vehicle using a floor jack. For safety, it's best to place the rear of the vehicle on jack stands once you have it raised. If the vehicle is equipped with a cover for the fuel pump (at the bottom of the fuel tank) remove the fuel pump cover. The cover will have a strap holding it to the bottom of the fuel tank and a single bolt (13 mm head) near the wheel well. Locate the fuel line going from the bottom of the fuel tank to the suction of the fuel pump and pinch the rubber fuel line using a hose clamp (as shown below). Using a flat tip screwdriver, loosen the hose clamp at the fuel pump suction and disconnect the hose from the pump. Be ready with a container to catch any fuel which will drain from the fuel line and fuel pump. Also, have some catch rags on hand to clean up any fuel that might spill from the lines. Place a container under the fuel line and loosen the hose clamp to start draining the fuel from the tank. When the container is full, pinch the line once again with the hose clamp to stop the flow of fuel until you can replace the full container with an empty container. Repeat this process until all of the fuel is drained from the tank. If you use containers which are clean to begin with and keep them clean by covering the container when it's full of fuel, you'll be able to reuse the fuel when the job is complete. Once the tank is completely drained, using a flat tip screwdriver, loosen the hose clamp and the fuel tank outlet and remove the hose from the tank outlet nozzle. You'll notice that the tank outlet is a larger round cover with a nozzle coming out of it. At the base of the nozzle (which you can't see too well with the hose attached), there is a hex head that's part of the nozzle. Using a 17 mm deep socket and ratchet or 17 mm wrench on the hex of the nozzle, turn counter-clockwise to remove the nozzle and strainer assembly. Make sure you have a container underneath the tank. The bottom of the strainer assembly is below the level of the nozzle so, some additional fuel (a small amount) will drain from the tank when the strainer is removed. When you get the strainer out, inspect the strainer for debris built up on the outside of the screen. You can see from the picture below that this particular strainer is very clean. You may find some debris at the base of the strainer (second picture below) which may be cleaned out using a small probe. However, be careful not to poke a hole in the strainer while you're cleaning that area.    You may clean the strainer if it is clogged by backflushing fuel or carburetor and choke cleaner back through the nozzle. You may also blow low pressure (10 psig max) air back through the strainer nozzle to loosen debris from the screen. If you discover any holes in the screen during cleaning, the strainer should be replaced. Install a new O-ring seal on the strainer. Coat the seal with a small amount of moly grease to lubricate the seal. This will keep it from binding and getting cut or abraded during installation. Install strainer and tighten using 17mm wrench or deep socket. Attach the fuel line to the strainer nozzle and fuel pump and tighten hose clamps. Refill the fuel tank and check the strainer assembly and fuel lines for leaks. Install the fuel pump cover (if equipped). Remove vehicle from jack / jack stands.

When this happens, the fuel rail voids and the car is difficult to start when it's been sitting for a while. When the engine is turned over, if the fuel rail is voided, it takes the fuel pump a while to refill and clear the voids from the rail so that the car will get enough fuel to start. Normally, if fuel rail voiding is caused by a leaking injector, you'll see lots of black smoke on subsequent startups. The following guide is intended to help you isolate fuel system leakdown problems. Tools Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Hose Clamping Tool Fuel Pressure Gauge and (if necessary) adapter for fuel rail DME/Fuel Pump relay jumper Catch rags Test Using FUEL-01, connect a fuel pressure gauge and install a DME/Fuel pump relay jumper to pressurize the fuel rail to normal operating pressure. With the fuel system operating at normal pressure, remove the DME/Fuel pump relay jumper to stop the fuel pump. Immediately install a hose clamping device on the rubber portion of the fuel line downstream of the Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR). If you are unsure of the FPR location, see FUEL-07 for pictures showing FPR locations. Note the fuel pressure and the time that you installed the hose clamp. This is the start time for the leakdown test. After 20 minutes, note the fuel pressure and compare it to the specified value in FUEL-01. If you're performing this procedure due to a failed leakdown test, also compare the pressure to the failed leakdown test pressure. If this pressure still fails the leakdown test, then the source of the leakage is not the FPR and you should proceed to the next step. If the pressure results in a successful leakdown test (assuming it was failing leakdown tests before), then the FPR is leaking and needs to be replaced. Remove the hose clamp from the FPR regulator line. Install the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to start the fuel pump and pressurize the fuel system. With the fuel system pressurized, remove the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to stop the fuel pump. Immediately install a hose clamping device on the rubber portion of the fuel line upstream of the Fuel Dampener. If you are unsure of the Fuel Dampener location, see FUEL-07 for pictures showing FPR locations. The Fuel Dampener looks almost identical to the FPR and is located either adjacent to the FPR on the fuel rail or at the opposite end of the fuel rail from the FPR. Note the fuel pressure and the time that you installed the hose clamp. This is the start time for the leakdown test. After 20 minutes, note the fuel pressure and compare it to the specified value in FUEL-01. If you're performing this procedure due to a failed leakdown test, also compare the pressure to the failed leakdown test pressure. If this pressure still fails the leakdown test, then the source of the leakage is not the Fuel Dampener and you should proceed to the next step. If the pressure results in a successful leakdown test (assuming it was failing leakdown tests before), then the fuel pump check valve is leaking and needs to be replaced. The fuel pump check valve is threaded into the inlet of the fuel pump. If the source of the fuel system leakdown is not the FPR or the Fuel Dampener, then it is most likely a leaking fuel injector. To determine which injector is leaking, remove the fuel rail with the injectors still attached. This may will likely require you to disconnect the fuel rail supply and return lines. One you have the fuel rail removed from the intake manifold (i.e. so you can see the tips of the injectors), reconnect the fuel supply and return lines to the rail. Place catch rags under each injector tip. Install the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to start the fuel pump and note which injector(s) is leaking. Replace or refurbish as necessary.

To do this, the gauge must be slid out of the dash enough to get your hand behind the cluster to unscrew the cable connection. By pushing all of the slack in the speedometer cable from the engine compartment through the dash into the passenger's compartment, you may be able to slid the gauges out enough to disconnect the cable. However, if this does not work, you'll have to remove the turn signal assembly to get enough room to disconnect the cable. Tools Phillips head screwdriver 24 mm socket (or 15/16&quot;) and ratchet Scribe, paint pen, or brightly colored nail polish Procedure Remove the horn button from the steering wheel and disconnect the electrical spade connector on the back of the horn button. Using a 24 mm (or 15/16&quot;) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and washer. Using a scribe, paint pen, or nail polish, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the end of the steering shaft. This will facilitate easier installation during re-assembly. Pull the steering wheel off the steering shaft. Remove the two Phillips head screws located in the outer to gauge pods. In the engine compartment, locate the speedometer cable and push as much of the slack in the cable through the firewall into the passenger's compartment. Slide the gauge assembly as far out as possible, reach behind the assembly, and unscrew the speedometer cable. If the gauges will not slide out enough to unscrew the speedometer cable, remove the turn signal switch assembly as follows: Remove the two screws holding the upper and lower steering column covers in place and remove the covers. The lower cover will come off easily. However, the upper cover will requires some wiggling to remove. Be careful when removing the covers as they are easily broken. Disconnect the electrical connectors for the turn signal switch assembly. Remove the three screws from the face of the turn signal switch assembly and remove the assembly from the steering shaft. You should now be able to move one side of the gauge cluster out far enough to get your hand behind the assembly and unscrew the speedometer cable. Once the speedometer cable is disconnected, slide the gauges out far enough to disconnect all the wires attached to the back of the gauges and then remove the cluster from the dash. The individual gauges can be removed from the cluster by pushing them from the back of the cluster out the front. Installation is the reverse of removal.

Using a scribe, paint pen, or nail polish, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the end of the steering shaft. This will facilitate easier installation during re-assembly. Pull the steering wheel off the steering shaft. As you can see from the picture below, this will make the gauge cluster removal much easier. Remove the three Phillips head screws located in the top of the plastic trim piece around the gauge cluster. A stubby Phillips head screwdriver works well here. Remove the two Phillips head screws which thread into the plastic trim piece from the bottom on either side of the steering column. The vents in the center of the dash are an integral part of the trim piece surrounding the instrument cluster. There are several Phillips screws located in the vents which must be removed to remove the instrument cluster trim piece. There is one Phillips head screw located in the vent area to the far right of the instrument cluster. There are two more Phillips head screws located in the vent area closest to the instrument cluster. Remove all three of these screws. Lift up on the bottom edge of the trim piece right behind the steering column trim piece. This will allow the gauge cluster trim top of the steering column. You may also need to pull down slightly on the top of the trim piece to clear the dash. The instrument cluster trim piece should now slide out of the dash. With the trim piece removed, you will now see the four Phillips head screws which hold the gauge cluster in the dash. Remove the screws and slide the cluster forward to access the electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. Slide the cluster forward enough to reach the electrical plug connectors on the back of the cluster. Be extremely careful when moving the cluster around and removing it. There is a ribbon circuit board on the back which can easily hang on the edges of the openings in the dash and tear (don't ask how I know). There are three electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. Each has a set of locking levers that hold the plug connector onto the back of the cluster. Push outward on the levers to release each connector and remove it from the back of the cluster. The instrument cluster will now slide out of the dash. You may have to tilt the cluster back slightly and slide on end out first. You may also need to push up on the instrument cluster opening in the dash to provide enough clearance to slide the cluster out. Be patient. Do not rush. Again, be careful of the ribbon circuit board on the back of the cluster. Installation is the reverse of removal.

Dave has also included information on how the motor circuits in later 944s differ from those of the early cars. However, the theory of operation and repair methods remain the same. I've added a few notes along the way and a different circuit diagram (with Dave's approval). We plan to expand this procedure down the road to describe how the entire exterior lighting circuit works in detail. But first, I have to figure out exactly how the bridge adapter in the later model 944 works. I'd like to thank Dave for his valuable contribution to Clark's Garage. Clark Fletcher Foreword by the Author My 944 had been reclaimed from an insurance company following a vandalism claim. The car had gone to a yard where some parts had been sold from it. In the process, the wiring harness had been cut in the front of the car and the headlight motor had been sold. When I purchased the car, the headlight motor in it had come from another wreck and was not connected. The internal circuit under the relay block had been rewired incorrectly. Finally, the mechanical headlight linkage was binding and several of the cap screws were loose. Surprisingly, most of the car was fine. So far, I have rebuilt all of the brake calipers, resurfaced or replaced all of the rotors, repacked the CV joints, fixed a number of electrical problems and cured some ills in the cooling system. I have learned that one of the most important things about the 944 is the assortment of clips and clamps that hold the various tubes, wires and hoses in place. When I got the car, the top rad hose was not clamped in place. One result was the circular-saw effect that had been applied by the alternator pulley to the hose. Cars that have seen work done by a number of different people may be subject to sloppiness in the area of what appears to be unimportant details. I'm resigned to the fact that, if I want a reliable car, the details must be identical to the way they were when the car left the factory. All told, I am enjoying working through the various systems of the 944, checking and rebuilding them. The car is different and my work has been an education. I have strived to do every task, by the book. Restoring the car's performance and reliability is my aim. David Simms, Kamloops, BC, Canada 1983-84 Porsche 944 Headlight Motor Circuit, Operation and Repair Components Motor Worm gear / Rotary Switch : This switch has three brushes which ride on a conducting disk. The inner brush has a cut-out that interrupts the current when the headlights have reached the off position. The center brush has an uninterrupted path. The outside brush has a cut-out that interrupts the current when the headlights have reached the on position. Relay This normally-off relay controls the motor. Uses Red/Blue conductor. Four Conductors: Control wires :Grey, Red/Green. Supply wire :Red/Blue. Ground Wire : Brown. S1 Normally-on switch, controlled by the headlight dash switch. Uses Red/Green conductor. S2 Normally-off switch, same as above. Uses Grey conductor. Dash Light Switch controls S1 and S2. Theory of Operation Initially, the ignition switch is on and the headlights are off. S1 is closed and the red/green conductor has 12 volts on it. The inner brush of the rotary switch resides on its cut-out. No current flows to the relay coil. The dash headlight switch is turned to on. Switch S1 is turned off (no effect). S2 is turned on, the grey conductor goes from zero to 12 volts. The outside brush on the rotary switch allows current to energize the relay coil. The relay closes the contact allowing current to flow along Red/Blue to the motor. The motor operates until the outside brush in the rotary switch meets its cut-out. Current to the relay is now interrupted. The motor turns off. The headlights are now in their on position. NOTE The first position on the headlight switch turns on the parking and license plate lights. The second position on the switch turns on the headlights and energizes the concealing motor to raise the headlights. C.F. The grey conductor still has 12 volts and the Red/green one has 0 volts. The dash headlight switch is now turned to the off position. S2 opens and S1 closes. The grey conductor goes to 0 volts, the Red/green one to 12 volts. The inner brush on the rotary switch energizes the relay coil. The motor operates until the inner brush touches its cut-out, turning off the relay and the motor. The headlights are now in their off position. This completes one cycle of headlight motor operation. NOTE If you've ever tried to operate raise the headlights manually, you probably found that when you reached a certain point raising the headlights that they automatically went back down. That's because the headlight concealing motor energizes to both raise and lower the headlights. As you rotate the dial on the motor, you also move the rotary switch. With the S1 switch closed, when the rotary switch contact is made, the motor energizes and returns to the closed position. If you wish to raise the headlights manually, you must remove Fuse #1 on the auxiliary fuse panel for early 944s or Fuse #2 on the main fuse panel for later model 944s. C.F. Notes Regarding the 1985 1/2 and more Recent Models Similarities & Differences Between Early/Late Models: Basic principles of Operation are the Same The Grey control wire is now Yellow/Blue The control wires are now fused The Red/Green wire requires a 7.5 A fuse in holder no.16 The Yellow/Blue wire takes a 7.5 A fuse in holder no.37 The Red/Blue supply wire takes a 25 A fuse in holder no. 2 These fuses must be checked before undertaking any repairs Maintenance Suggestions If the car is new-to-you, check the fuse values: 16 amps in the no. 1 fuse holder on the Additional Fuse Box (Early 944s). For later cars, check the three fuses listed above. Turn the manual control knob on the headlight motor to take the system through one cycle, note any points of excessive resistance. Remember to remove the motor fuses before trying to cycle the motor manually. Try to locate where the rubbing occurs. It will probably occur where the headlight assembly passes through the bodywork. You may need to remove foreign material. Or, you may need to adjust the alignment of the linkage. Note the sheet metal tabs on either side of the car above the radiator. On each tab are three small cap screws. You can make small adjustments to the linkage here. Your car may have sustained front-end damage and folds in the body metal may be rubbing on the headlight housings as they change position. Consult a body man if this is preventing the proper operation of the headlight linkage. Grease the ball-joints in the linkage with lithium-based grease. Proper lubrication will make a surprising difference in the resistance encountered by the headlight concealing motor. Repair Procedures Headlights too low or too high Start the car. Turn on the headlights. Unscrew the linkage from the motor shaft without turning it. Reposition the headlights manually while holding the linkage that you just removed from the motor. Reconnect the linkage to the motor shaft. Try turning the headlights on / off once more to verify the correct position. Repeat the procedure, if necessary. Headlights turn on but do not move Check Fuses. On the '85 1/2 and later models, the control wires are fused too. The headlight motor assembly will probably have to be removed from the car. First, disconnect the 4-pin connector to the motor. Check the voltages on the conductors. Motor or ignition on Light switch off. Brown and grey: 0 volts, Red/Green and Red/Blue: 12 volts Motor or ignition on Light switch on. Brown and Red/Green: 0 volts. Grey and Red/Blue: 12 volts. Motor or ignition off Light switchoff . Brown and grey : 0 volts. Red/Green and Red/Blue : 12 volts. If the voltages are not as above, the problem lies in the headlight relay or dash switch. Remove and check them with an ohmmeter. Check the continuity of the conductors. Have fun !! If the voltages have the prescribed values, remove the motor assembly. The unit will have to be bench-tested. Bench-testing the motor unit Remove unit from car. Disconnect motor shaft from linkage. Remove four-pin electrical connector from motor assembly Remove the three screws holding the unit to the car Remove the rubber covers from the motor assembly Do a visual/electrical check of components Check condition of the relay points. If they are burned, file the points or replace the relay. Check continuity of relay coil with an ohmmeter. The wire is fine and can easily break. The resistance of the coil is about 65 Ohms. If there is no continuity, the relay will need to be replaced. If the above checks out all right, remove the relay block from the motor. Check the male and female connectors in the four-pin connector for damage. You may need to bring the unit to your local supplier to get compatible connectors if they are damaged. Check wiring of the relay block. terminals 1 &amp; 3: To motor and Red/Blue. terminals 2 &amp; 5: To the relay coil, from ground and center brush on rotary switch terminal 5: No connection. Remove the rotary switch cover and check the brushes. If a brush is damaged, it can be removed by de-soldering it from the external wire. You may be able to get a replacement from an appliance repairman or to fashion one from a piece of flat brass. The amount of current flowing through these brushes is negligible if everything is working properly. Therefore, the construction of these brushes, apart from their length, is not critical. Test the motor This is probably the least likely area of failure. Remove the motor relay from the relay block by prying gently with a screwdriver. Fit a spade-type female connector to a piece of wire and insert it into the relay side of terminal 1 or 3 (whichever will connect to the green motor wire). Connect the case of the motor to the negative terminal of a battery or battery charger and the other wire to the positive terminal. If the motor does not turn, look for a poor connection, otherwise, a new motor is required. Repairing the rubber boots. With time and temperature changes, the rubber boots protecting your headlight motor may have split along their seams. Clean and lightly sand the areas adjoining the split. Apply tape to the inside of the split so that the boot is held together. Apply several layers of automotive GOOP to the split, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next. Remove the tape and apply layers of GOOP to the inside of the split. Trim off any excess. Your boot should be able to withstand some vigorous stretching as it is put back on the motor.

While the cycling normally occurs going from the raised position to lower position, it can also occur going from the lowered position to the raised position. The electrical contact wheel provides a continuous electrical flow path for the headlight motor to keep it energized when the headlight switch is operated. The only exception is two small plastic inserts into the wheel which break the electrical contact at the full up position and at the full down position. Over time, corrosion builds up on the contact wheel. The corrosion gets carried by the contacts onto the normally non-conducting plastic inserts on the wheel. A film of corrosion eventually builds up on the inserts and they will conduct enough electricity to keep the motor energized and the headlights rotate up and down. To correct the problem, the headlight motor has to be removed, the gear assembly cover removed, and the contact wheel cleaned. The following procedure will provide step-by-step instructions for removing and cleaning the headlight motor. Tools Metric Wrench / Socket Set Steel Wool, Emery Cloth, or Fine Grit Sandpaper (see procedure) Flat tip screwdriver Headlight Motor Removal Disconnect the battery. Disconnect the headlight motor electrical plug and remove relay. If the motor is equipped with a manual raising and lowering dial (some early cars are not), raise the headlight to the 1/2 to 3/4 raised position. This will make all of the motor mounting bolts easily accessible. Remove the bottom two 10mm bolts that hold the motor to the mounting bracket. Lower the headlights back to the full down position. This is done to retain the motor-to-linkage alignment when the motor is removed. Remove the 13mm nut from the end of the drive shaft of the motor (that holds the headlight linkage to the motor shaft). Remove the remaining (top) 10mm bolt that holds the motor to the bracket. You'll probably have to use a flat tip screwdriver or pry bar to separate the linkage from the motor shaft. Once you're done remove the motor from the car. Cleaning the Headlight Motor Assembly This is probably the hardest part of the whole job. There's a rubber boot that covers the bottom of the motor and the gear housing that must be removed. Work it down off of the motor, around the bottom of the gear assembly, over the drive shaft in the back (that's the hard part), and finally off of the relay block. Work slowly and carefully and you can do this without damaging the boot. There are six flat head screws that hold the gear assembly cover. However, you can only see five of them as one is under the relay block. As you remove the screws pay careful attention to the location of each screw as they are different lengths. In the pictures below, you'll see the location of the six screws and the size of the screws that go in each location by the numbers. First remove the two screw that hold the relay block in place (one long, one short). Move the relay block out of the way and remove the screw underneath the block. Remove the remaining three screws. Remove the gear assembly cover carefully as there are electrical contacts on the back side of the cover. Be careful when you remove the cover as there is a small ball bearing in the center of the contact wheel. Remove that ball bearing and set it to one side so you don't lose it. Behind the cover, you'll find the contact wheel which will probably be pretty dirty. You'll see two plastic areas on the wheel and several plastic tabs which hold the wheel to the large gear behind it. Clean the gear with steel wool, emery cloth, or fine grit sandpaper. My contact wheel was pretty dirty and steel wool didn't work too well. I recommend 440 grit sandpaper but, I had to use 220 grit paper because that's all I had. If you use 220 grit paper just sand lightly and don't get too aggressive. Blow all of the debris out of the gear assembly when you're done cleaning the wheel. Install the gear assembly cover and relay block. Again, make sure that the different length screws are in their correct positions. Here's the second hardest part of the job. Install the rubber boot back onto the motor assembly. Place the boot over the relay block first and then slowly work it over the gear assembly. The hardest part is getting the boot over the gear assembly drive shaft. The easiest way I've found to do this is to stick two fingers inside the boot as you're working it over the gear assembly, placing them on either side of the gear assembly shaft, and pull the boot up and over shaft. You'll have to do this several times to basically &quot;walk&quot; the boot until it reaches the shaft opening in the boot. Headlight Motor Installation Before installing the motor install the relay and electrical plug and set the motor somewhere (on top of the washer reservoir is a good spot) where the motor shaft isn't touching anything. Then temporarily reconnect the battery. This will reset the motor back to the fully lowered position in case it moved during cleaning. Then disconnect the battery and motor electrical plug and relay. Install the motor back to the mounting bracket. Install the top 10mm bolt and the bottom front bolt (but do not fully tighten) without moving the linkage. The bottom one is tough but, this ensures that the motor is in proper alignment with the linkage. Next, install the 13mm bolt that holds the linkage to the motor shaft and tighten. Using the knob on top of the motor, rotate the headlights to the 1/2 to 3/4 raised position. This will facilitate installing the bottom rear motor mounting bolt (10mm). Tighten all of the motor mounting bolts and lower the headlights to the full down position. As a side note, during manipulation of the headlights, it's a very good time to lubricate the linkage. Plug in the relay and motor electrical plug. Reconnect the battery. Test the headlights to make sure they are operating properly.

That's primarily because the early HVAC system are of a much simpler design and is much less prone to malunctions. There's also not a great deal of information in print on the operation of the early HVAC systems. As more definitive information on the early 944 HVAC system becomes available, I'll be adding to this procedure. The early 944s have separate heating and A/C systems which provide air flow to a common mixing chamber. Each system has it's own housing and blower. Air flow through the system is contolled by flappers which are operated by cables. The heater control valve is also controlled by a cable. So, when there's a problem with the system where there's no heat or excessive heat, it's normally due to a broken or disconnected cable. On the later model 944 HVAC systems, the A/C evaporator and heater core are contained in the same housing. Temperature control is automatic and is controlled by 3 temperature sensors. Once a temperature is selected it is maintained automatically by the temperature control unit repositioned dampers to control air flow through the unit. The temperature control unit determines how to position the dampers by comparing the signals from the three sensors. Once sensor senses outside air temperature. All air flow therefore passes through the A/C. From there it is either directed fhrough the heater core or bypassed the heater core (via a system of flappers) and into the cabin. Below are pictures of the late model 944 HVAC component locations. ENGINE COMPARTMENT HVAC COMPONENT LOCATIONS HVAC UNIT FRONT VIEW (DASH REMOVED) HVAC UNIT LEFT SIDE HVAC UNIT RIGHT SIDE HVAC AIR FLOW DIAGRAM HVAC SYSTEM CONTROLS (LATE MODEL 944s) Full Heat at All Temperature Settings (Pre-1985.5 944s and All 924s) On the early 944s pre-1985.5 full heat problems are somewhat unusual. However, when it happens, it is normally caused by the bowden cable for the heater unit damper coming loose. This will be much easier said than done but, you'll need to locate the bowden cables on the back of the heater controls on the center console and follow them until you locate the correct damper. There should be three cables. One for the heater unit damper, one for the AC unit damper, and one for the heater control valve (the heater control valve cable will go through the firewall). The damper for the heater unit is behind the center console. And, the AC unit damper is on the passenger's side of the vehicle. So, locate the cable for the heater unit damper and see if it is disconnected or broken. Full Heat at All Temperature Settings (1985.5 and Newer 944s) On late model 944s (1985.5 and newer), there are several problems that can cause the full heat condition. The first and most common problem is a damper linkage in the driver's side footwell (for left-hand drive cars). Stick your head in the footwell and look up and toward the center console. You should see a small diameter metal rod which rests in a white plastic support and is held in place by a metal retaining clip. On later model 944s, there are two damper linkages instead of one and they are located behind a plastic cover. One of the plastic clips on the linkage may be broken preventing the linkage from operating the damper. When the damper fails to operate, the system fails to full heat. Most German cars are designed to fail this way. It's a safety feature to keep you from freezing in winter. The first picture below shows a linkage that has come loose from the support because the metal clip is broken. The second picture show the linkage properly in place with a new support and clip along with the part numbers for the support and clip. The second problem is with the heater control valve. The heater control valve is vacuum operated and located at the back of engine near the firewall. There is a vacuum line which goes from the valve to a vacuum connection at the firewall where the heater hose connections penetrate the firewall. Check this vacuum line to make sure it is connected and doesn't show any signs of cracking. There is another vacuum line fitting near the heater hose connections which goes to a rubber &quot;Y&quot; connector. One side of the &quot;Y&quot; goes to a small check valve attached to the large brake booster vacuum line at the back of the firewall. The other side of the &quot;Y&quot; goes through the firewall to a plastic vacuum retention canister next to the battery. Make sure all these lines are connected and don't show any signs of cracking. If all vacuum lines are properly connected you may wish to remove the heater control valve from the system and check it's operation with a vacuum tester. A problem with the heater control valve opening may also be caused by the vacuum solenoid valve going bad. Remove the solenoid and apply 12 VDC to valve to see if it opens and closes properly. If you look at the picture titled HVAC UNIT RIGHT SIDE above, the solenoid is component #3. Finally, a full heat condition can be caused by a failure of the Temperature Control Unit (TCU) itself. Unfortunately, I don't have a good way to test the TCU at the moment. And, they're quite expensive unless you can find one from a car that's being parted out. So, replace the TCU as a last resort. Intermittent Heat If your car's heater works fine while driving down the road but the air from the vents becomes cold at idle, you probably have air in the coolant system. Air pockets in the coolant system often accumulate in the heater core. At higher engine RPMs the coolant pump will develop enough discharge head to force some coolant through the heater core. However, at idle, the air pocket will keep coolant from flowing through the core. If you are experiencing these symptoms, vent the coolant system using the COOL-02, Coolant System Draining, Filling, and Venting.

NOTE When you remove the nose panel, you will find that the crest is held in place by two posts. The posts will be held by one of two different types of retaining nuts. One is a spring clip and the other is a screw-on type nut. The spring clips have a tendency to become loose over time and in the case of my own car resulted in the hood crest getting blown off on the interstate. The picture below show the back of a nose panel with retaining clips. When installing a new hood crest kit with retaining nuts these clips will have to be removed from the panel. If the old crest to be removed is held in place by the spring clips, the crest must be removed by sliding a putty knife under the crest and prying it off of the nose panel. I really don't like doing this because there's a risk of damaging the paint. So, I typically use a plastic putty knife or simply cut the spring clips (since I'll be removing them anyway) away from the posts on the hood crest using a pair of end cutters. NOTE The new hood crest kit (shown below) will come with a hood crest, gasket, and two retaining nuts with a sealant putty on the back. It may be extremely difficult to get the gasket to remain fitted onto the hood crest properly while the crest is being installed. I advise stretching the gasket slightly before installing it onto the crest and apply a small amount of trim adhesive to hold the gasket onto the crest. Install the gasket onto the hood crest. Place the crest on the nose panel and install the backing nuts. Do not full tighten the nuts yet. It may still be impossible to keep the lip of the gasket fitted over the edges of the crest while it is being installed. So, it may be necessary to roll the lip of the gasket out from under the crest and around it's edges after the crest is installed onto the nose panel. Consequently, don't tighten the nuts for the hood crest until you're sure the gasket is correctly positioned on the crest. The picture below demonstrates how to roll the lip of the gasket using a straight probe. A small flat tip jeweler's screwdriver works very well also. Use caution when rolling the lip on the gasket so as not to damage it. Once the gasket is in place around the outside edge of the hood crest, tighten the backing nuts until they are snug. Do not over tighten the nuts as it will squeeze out all of the sealing putty.

The solution to this problem is to remove the old hood insulation. After the hood insulation is removed, you can replace it with new insulation or you can simply leave the insulation off. On late model 944s, Porsche did not install hood insulation. Tools Soft cloth Plastic scraper 3M Woodgrain and Trim Remover Soft blanket, large rug, or large soft piece of carpet (to lay hood on while removing insulation) Procedure First, remove the hood from the vehicle as follows. You'll need and assistant to help you with this. Disconnect all of the hoses for the windshield washer nozzles. You'll also need to disconnect to disconnect the wires for the washer nozzle heaters. Disconnect and remove the hood shocks. Prop up the hood. You can buy a professional hood prop at many auto parts store. However, a broom stick cut to proper length works almost as well. Finish removing the hood by loosening and removing the bolts that attach the hood to the hinges (two bolts per side). Have an assistant help you lift the hood off of the car and lay it upside down on a blanket. Using your hand or a plastic scraper, remove as much of the old hood insulation as possible. What should remain is primarily the adhesive used to attach the hood insulation. Apply the 3M Woodgrain and Trim Remover to the hood insulation adhesive and allow it to sit for approximately 5 minutes. Using a soft cloth, to gently rub away the softened adhesive. DO NOT USE any type of scraper after applying the trim remover. Sometimes the trim remover will soften the paint. If you use any type of scraper, you chance damaging the paint underneath.

However, the idle speed adjusting screw will sometimes back out causing idle speed to become out of adjustment. The 944S and S2 models use a system called &quot;adaptive idle speed volumetric efficiency regulation&quot; and do not require idle speed adjustment. Tools Flat Tip Screwdriver Wire Jumper with round male connectors or Special Tool 9246 ('85½ and newer models) Temperature measuring device for engine oil Idle Adjustment Turn off the fan motor and AC Compressor during idle adjustment. Start the vehicle and allow it to idle to warm up the engine. The factory manual specifies performing the idle adjustment with the engine oil temperature between 70 - 90 °C (158 - 194 °F). The factory measuring device uses a probe which inserts into the oil dipstick tube. Since most of us can't justify investing in the factory measuring device, we have to come up with some other method of determining the oil temperature. Personally, I use a contact temperature gauge and measure the temperature on the bottom of the oil pan. If you wish to try the idle adjustment without measuring the oil temperature, run the engine for about 10 minutes after the coolant is at normal operating temperature. For '85½ and newer models defeat the operation of the idle stabilizer by installing the jumper between terminals B and C of the diagnostic plug (see diagram). If you happen to have Special Tool 9246 (Test Relay), it can be used instead of the wire jumper to defeat the idle stabilizer. The idle stabilizer is not operating when the green lamp on the test relay is lit. Using a flat tip screwdriver or 7mm (9/32&quot;) socket, turn the idle speed adjusting screw until the idle speed is within specification for your model vehicle.

So, take a look at your ignition switch and if it's cracked, it's likely the source of your problem This procedure is used for testing purposes to determine the condition of the cranking portion of the ignition switch and the wiring from the ignition switch to the starter. Tools Wire jumpers Multimeter Testing Procedure Disconnect the battery positive lead. Disconnect the electrical plug from the ignition switch. Check the operation of the cranking contacts on the ignition switch as follows: Connect an ohmmeter between Terminals 30 and 50 on the ignition switch. If you are unsure which terminals those are, look at the electrical connector for the wires that attach to the ignition switch. If the wires were still connected to the ignition switch, Terminal 30 would be connected to the large diameter Red Wire and Terminal 50 would be connected to the large diameter Red Wire with Black Stripe. Turn the ignition switch to the start position as if cranking the engine and read the resistance. The resistance should go from and infinite resistance to approximately 0 ohms when the switch is turned. If the correct resistance is not obtained the ignition switch is bad and should be replaced. If the ignition switch checks okay, check the ignition wiring as follows: Disconnect the wire from the switch terminal on the starter solenoid (bendix).

It will make your ignition switch replacement a breeze. Foreword by Author I was having starting problems that were driving me crazy. I re-soldered the DME, replaced the coil, and checked the speed and reference sensors. Everything was ok. Finally I located the problem. With the ignition switch and its associated mounting out of the car, it would start no problem. As soon as I install it in the car it would not work. Closer inspection of the switch revealed that it was cracked . These are a couple of photos of the broken switch. Crack in the side of Ignition Switch Looking at front of the Switch Back of the switch The following is a basic set of instructions and photos from my 1987 924s. This car does not have air bags and I have a Dino Wheel so your car may be different. Ok lets get started. First off you will be dealing with allot of little screws. Make sure that you have a container to put them in as you take things apart. It is also important to lay things out in order as you remove then as it is easy to leave something out during the reassembly Dean Smith Tools that you will need: Phillips screwdriver #1 Tip (smallest of the standard sizes) Metric Allen wrench set Couple of various sized flat screwdrivers Small pry-bar Hammer Brass drft or large deep dish socket Small scribe or small coal chizzes to mark location of the wheel relative to the steering column You may need a Steering wheel puller Good Shop Light Lets Get Started Here is my steering wheel. Note that it is centered and double check that the wheels are strait. Here is a couple of photos of the left and right sides. To remove my wheel I have to take the six Allen bolts out in the center of the wheel. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL. Refer to BODY-25, Steering Wheel Removal and Installation for more information on steering wheel removal. Once the wheel is free you have to disconnect the wires for the horn. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL Next remove the rubber boot from around the adaptor/crush zone.THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL On my set up there is a marking for where the &quot;TOP&quot; should be. If you have not done it already make sure your wheel is centered. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL Next remove the center nut. This may requite some muscle Mine comes off rather easy. I put a large screwdriver through the adaptor bracket and hold it while I take the nut off with a socket. Take the nut and washer of but DON'T TAKE THE ADAPTOR / WHEEL OFF YET. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL Once the nut and washer are off you have to scribe the shaft and the adaptor. On the stock wheel you will be scribing the wheel. The mark on the adaptor is hard to see but it is there. Note the mark on the steering column. Once you mark or index the parts you can continue taking it apart. Slide the steering wheel or steering wheel adapter off of the steering column. Now you are looking at the top of the switches / stalks. Remove the three flat head screws on top of the stalk. Now that you have removed the screws the stalks will be loose. You now have to remove the plastic housing around the stalks. It splits longitudinally and is held in place with two screws that are from below. The reason I did not remove this first is it is easier with the wheel removed and with the stalks loose it is easier to remove the plastic pieces. Here are a couple of photos showing the screw locations looking up from below. Here is a photo of the two screws. Note that they are two different sizes. Now it is time to CAREFULLY slide the stalks off the column. There are a bunch of wires connected to the switches. In my car I don't have to remove them. I carefully pull them forward from underneath as I gently pull on the switches out. You will also note that the two stalks / switches can separate from each other. If this happens it is ok. Just carefully continue to pull/guide the wires out until the switch clearers the steering column. Repeat the process with the second one. If the two switches came apart I then CAREFULLY put the two switches back together once they are removed. The following photo shows the top switch removed. This photo shows the bottom switch removed. Both switches removed and reassembled. Note that I still have the wires attached. You could remove the wires but I prefer to do it this way because if you forget to hook up a wire that happens to pull back through the dash it will be a real pain to attach it after you put it all back together. Another photo of the two switches. This is what you should now have left. Note the three little holes that are where the three screws went that hold the switches. These can be broken off very easily. DO NOT PRY/LEAN or hang anything from these. If you brake any of these you will have to replace the whole piece. A couple of other things to note ate the bearings around the column and the Allen head bolt that is visible on the left side of the column. Here is another photo from the side. The next thing to remove is the plastic spacer collar that is around the steering column. To get this off I pry gently but firmly in the slots around the bottom. Once it moves a little I switch to a small pry bar that is thicker and wider than my largest screwdriver and carefully work it off. DO NOT PRY ON ANY OF THE THREE SMALL SCREW HOLE'S AS THEY WILL BRAKE OFF. The piece that my screwdriver is touching is the spacer collar. The piece removed. Now you have to remove the Allen head bolt on the left side of the column. You get at this through a whole in the bottom of the dash. With this bolt removed the asemble with the ignition switch will slide out. Note that there are a bunch of wires attached to the back of the switch. Unplug the wires from the back of the ignition switch. Now flip the piece over and look at the back where the wires were plugged in and you will see a small Phillips screw. Remove this and the switch will slide out. Here is the unit with the screw removed. You can then slide the switch out. On my new switch I put some grease on the end of the switch where the tang from the lock engages as this will see alot of wear. You are now ready start the reassembly. I will not cover the whole thing just a couple of highlights. When I put the bracket back I packed the bearings with fresh grease. The plastic ring/spacer will get some burs on it. I lightly sanded / filed them off before I reinstalled it. I also put a light coating of grease inside to aid in it slipping back on. When reinstalling this do not use a screwdriver and a hammer to tap it in place. It will damage the plastic or even split it. I use a large deep socket and tap on it alternating forum side to side. When I install the plastic trim pieces I again do this with the switches in place but not screwed in place. this will give you a little play when you put the trim pieces back on. In the following photo you will se how I place the top trim piece. I then push it down and back in place. It should just snap in place. Well that about covers it. I hope this helps.

If so, you should have already verified that you actually have a no spark condition by performing the initial &quot;no spark&quot; test described in TS-01, Troubleshooting - Engine Will Not Start. There are many different ways to go about testing for a no spark condition. The only problem in determining the ultimate cause of a no spark condition is that if the condition is caused by a problem with the DME computer, there's really no way to conclusively test the DME. The same is true with a no fuel condition. So, what we have to do is determine, as best we can, whether the DME is getting power and whether it's getting all of the correct input signals it requires to run the engine. If we get all of the proper inputs and the DME is still not providing the desired output (i.e. spark from the ignition coil or running the fuel pump), we make the assumption that the DME computer is bad and we replace it. One of the best ways to test the DME computer is to swap it for a known good DME computer. However, most of us don't have the luxury of keeping a spare DME computer on hand. However, if you suspect that starting or running problem may be due to a bad DME computer, try to borrow a computer to test your car before running out and buying a DME. Tools Mulitmeter Test lead jumpers No Spark Condition Possible Cause Comments Bad Distributor Cap / Rotor Inspect distributor cap and rotor per procedure below. Bad Ignition Coil Check coil using Ignition Coil Test procedure below. Bad Engine Cranking / Running Signal to DME Check engine cranking / running signals using FUEL-16. Faulty DME computer Check DME computer using FUEL-16. Distributor Cap and Rotor Inspection Grasp the distributor cap and attempt to move it back and forth. If it moves easily, the retaining screws are not properly engaged or the distributor cap gasket is compressed and needs to be replaced. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap. Inspect the distributor cap for the following and replace as necessary: Cracks Carbon tracking Moisture buildup on inside of cap Debris Worn rotor button Pitted, worn, or charred terminals Inspect the rotor for charring or pitting and replace if necessary. Check the rotor retaining screw is in place. These screws have a tendency to fall out causing the rotor to become misaligned. Ensure the dust cover is securely in place behind the rotor. This dust cover is important because it keeps debris from the belt housing area from getting into the distributor cap and causing poor or non-existent spark. Ignition Coil Test Disconnect the ignition coil output wire at the distributor cap. Connect a spark plug to the end of the ignition coil output wire which you just disconnected. Connect a ground wire to the threaded portion of the spark plug. Disconnect the ignition coil ground wire from the negative terminal on the coil (Green Wire). Connect one end of a ground wire to the ignition coil negative terminal. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Tap the other end of the ignition coil ground wire jumper on an good grounding point (for example the battery negative terminal) and look for sparks at the spark plug that correspond to the frequency of your tapping of the ground wire. If you have a good spark at the spark plug, the ignition coil is good. If you don't get a good spark, check for approximately 12 VDC from the coil positive terminal (black wire) to ground with the ignition switch in the ON position. You should also get approximately 12 VDC from the coil negative terminal (Green wire) to ground Ignition Coil Resistance Check In addition to the test above, you may elect to perform an ignition coil resistance check as confirmation of the coil's condition. Check the ignition coil primary coil resistance by connecting an ohmmeter between the positive (Black wire) and negative (Green wire) terminals on the coil. The resistance should be 0.4 to 0.6 ohms. Check the ignition coil secondary coil resistance by connecting an ohmmeter between the coil output terminal and the ignition coil negative terminal. The resistance should be 5000 to 7200 ohms.

Primarily for late model 944 owners (1985.5 and newer). The most common misconception is that Porsche simply didn't put bright enough bulbs in the instruments. That may be partially true. According to the Porsche PET, the bulbs are 12 VDC, 3 watt bulbs. However, I've never seen any bulbs come out of a cluster that were anything but 12V 2 watt bulbs. There are a wide range of higher wattage bulbs available for the late model gauge clusters. However, for the early 944 gauge which us a #37 bulb, there aren't really any options. Quite often, late model 944 owners will attempt to alleviate their low light problem by installing the largest wattage bulb they can find (typically 4-5 watts). It doesn't take long to figure out that this course of action by itself is a mistake. The 4-5 watt bulbs draw too much power. So, the bulbs tend to overheat and burn out very quickly. The other problem here is that the higher wattage bulbs produce so much heat that they will melt the bulb holders. Consequently, the largest wattage bulb that should be used in the 944 instrument panel is in the 3-4 watt range. See the table below for bulb recommendations. Now, going to a larger 3-4 watt bulb alone may not provide a significant improvement in illumination. The other problem that occurs with the dash lighting is related to the individual bulb holders. The instrument bulb holders are clear and are coated on the outside with a silver reflective material which intensifies the light from the bulb. Over time, this coating tends to flake and peel off the outside of the bulb housing or get scraped off if the cluster has been removed causing degraded instrument illumination. To fix this problem, you need to remove all of the old reflective material from the outside of the bulb housing and replace it with some type of new material. If your housing is not scratched or flaking, a bulb change may be all you need to fix your illumination problem. If you find that your bulb holder reflective surface is scratched or peeling and you don't want to try and fix it yourself, you can order a new lens assembly. 944Online.com ( http://www.944online.com) sells the assembly in their new parts section (approximately $99 plus shipping). If you have a Porsche dealership close by, the part number is 944 641 941 01. The current price at the Porsche dealer (08-15-05) is $95.12 USD and if you pick up at the dealership there's no shipping. To determine if your gauge cluster lens assembly is damaged, you'll first need to remove the instrument cluster from the dash ( Early Cluster Removal or Late Cluster Removal).To remove the old reflective material from the bulb housing, DO NOT attempt to remove the reflective assemblies from the lens housing. I did however, removed the lens assembly from the instrument cluster to prevent damaging the gauges while cleaning the bulb holders. There are nine (9) Phillips head screws on the back of the assembly which hold the lens assembly to the instrument cluster. Use some type of solvent to remove the reflective material but, do not use anything that will damage the plastic housing. I used non-acetone finger nail polish remover which worked very well. You might also try model paint thinner. If the coating is peeling badly you may be able to peel the coating off with an exacto-knife. However, I don't recommend it. Do not sand the material off as it will scratch the surface of the housing and adversely affect the reflective ability of the new coating. The pictures below show the process of removing the old reflective coating (nail polish remover and paper towel) and the After the old coating is removed from the housing, apply a new coating to the housing. Several things have been suggested for use as a new coating. The most common is aluminum foil attached to the housing with double-sided clear tape or clear adhesive. Another suggestion was to paint the outside of the housing with silver or chrome model paint. Personally, I tried painting the housings with silver metallic enamel first which did not work well at all. So, I removed the paint and used aluminum foil (shiny side toward the housing). This worked much better. I didn't have any double-sided clear tape or appropriate adhesive so, I simply taped the foil to the housing using masking tape. Down the road, I'll probably go back and use double-sided clear tape. However, it's still a good idea to tape over the back of the foil to protect it and keep it from getting torn. As a side note, I am personally using the Sylvania 194 bulbs (3.78 watts). Along with refurbishing the bulb holder coverings, this provides a good improvement in illumination. Originally, I tried a Sylvania 161 bulb (2.66 watts) as that is what comes installed in aftermarket Autometer gauges and I wanted to have the same level of illumination from all my gauges. However, I found that the factory instrument cluster requires a higher wattage bulb to achieve the same level of illumination as the Sylvania 161 bulb in an Autometer gauge. The Sylvania 194 along with the bulb cover refurbishing gave (in my case) the same level of illumination. Depending on how well your refurbishing job is done (and mine wasn't done all that well), you may have to play around with different bulb wattages to get the same level of illumination as your aftermarket gauges. Also, if you decide to replace the lens assembly with a new assembly you'll likely be able to use a lower wattage bulb. I've provided some bulb recommendations below. However, there are many other bulb wattages available. Your local auto parts store (NAPA and CarQuest in particular) will have a book that contains a listing of all the bulbs and wattages available. The location of the bulb holders on the back of the cluster are shown below. Bulb Recommendations Manufacturer Bulb Number Wattage Comments Sylvania 158 3.3 W Recommended. Offers a slight improvement over the factory bulbs and will not experience overheating problems. In USA, available at most NAPA and CarQuest. Not widely available at Auto Zone, Advance Auto, or PEP Boys. Sylvania 161 2.66 W Not Recommended. Offers little improvement over the factory bulbs. In USA, widely available at most auto parts stores. Sylvania 168 4.9 W Not Recommend. Likely to produce too much heat and hence burn out quickly or cause damage to bulb holder. Readily available at most auto parts stores in USA. Sylvania 192 4.3 W Questionable. May produce too much heat and hence burn out quickly. In USA, available at most NAPA and CarQuest. Not widely available at Auto Zone, Advance Auto, or PEP Boys. Sylvania 193 4.62 W Not Recommend. Great improvement over the factory bulbs but, likely to produce too much heat and hence burn out quickly or cause damage to bulb holder. In USA, available at most NAPA and CarQuest. Not widely available at Auto Zone, Advance Auto, or PEP Boys. Sylvania 194 3.78 W Recommended. Overall, may be the best choice for a lighting upgrade. Offers a good improvement over the factory bulbs and does not produce too much heat. In USA, available at most NAPA and CarQuest. Not widely available at Auto Zone, Advance Auto, or PEP Boys.

Disconnect spark plug wires from spark plugs and move out of the way. Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. On normally aspirated cars, remove the air intake hose from between the air flow sensor and the throttle body. On turbocharged cars, remove the pipe between the intercooler outlet and the throttle body. Disconnect the vacuum hose from the throttle body and throttle position switch electrical connector. Remove the oil dipstick tube to intake manifold mounting bolt. On turbocharged cars, remove the oil air separator bracket to intake manifold bolts (near oil filler tube)(2 - M6 Allen head bolts). Disconnect all hoses from the intake manifold. NOTE On normally aspirated cars, there are hoses underneath the intake manifold which can not be disconnected from the intake until it is lifted. At the back of the intake manifold, disconnect the speed and reference sensor electrical connector mounting bracket from the intake manifold by loosing the retaining bolt and sliding the bracket off. Loosen the intake manifold brace bolt. On normally aspirated cars the bolt needs to be removed. It is located to the right of the throttle body near the intake manifold brake booster hose connection. On turbocharged cars, the bolt only needs to be loosened and is located to the left of the throttle body under the front edge of the intake manifold. Disconnect the throttle cable. If equipped, disconnect the cruise control cable from the servo unit (mounted on firewall near battery tray). Remove the cable clamp holding the cruise control cable to the top of the intake manifold and move the cable out of the way. Remove the intake manifold retaining bolts (8 - M8 Allen head bolts) using a 6 mm Allen head socket or 6 mm hex key. A long (6&quot;) 6 mm Allen head socket works well for this application. NOTE The intake manifold bolts tend to bond themselves to the cylinder head making it very easy to strip the heads on the bolts. To avoid stripping the heads refer to BOLT-01 for &quot;waking up&quot; the bolts. If the intake manifold does not lift off the head easily, strike the intake with a rubber mallet to break it free. On normally aspirated cars, lift up the intake manifold and disconnect the vacuum lines on the bottom of the manifold. Remove the intake manifold from the car. If other work is to be performed while the intake manifold is removed, cover the cylinder head intake ports (stuff clean rags into the ports or cover them with duct tape). Intake Installation Remove the old intake manifold gaskets from the cylinder head and intake manifold using a scraper. Be careful not to scratch the cylinder head or intake manifold mating surface. Apply a small amount of grease to the intake manifold gaskets to hold them in place and install the gaskets on to the cylinder head. NOTE Pay close attention to the orientation of the intake manifold gaskets when installing. On some cars, the gaskets are shaped identically but, must be oriented differently during installation. For example, on turbocharged cars, the #1 cylinder gasket orientation is not the same as the #2, #3, and #4 cylinders. While the gasket can be installed in the same orientation as the other cylinders and still fit, if done so, the gasket will partially block the injector flow path affecting the injector spray pattern. Set the manifold into position on the cylinder head. On normally aspirated cars, attach the vacuum hoses to the bottom of the intake manifold as it is lowered into place. Ensure the intake manifold lines up with the intake manifold brace. On turbocharged cars, the intake manifold is installed with the bolt already on the intake manifold. As the manifold is lowered the bolt will slide in to the &quot;U&quot; of the intake manifold brace. Torque the brace bolt (M8) to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Install the intake manifold retaining bolts (8 - M8 Allen head) and torque to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Connect the fuel supply and return lines. Connect the vacuum line connections to the fuel damper and fuel pressure regulator. If equipped, connect the cruise control cable to the cruise control servo. Connect the throttle cable to the throttle body. Connect the vacuum line to the throttle body and the electrical connector to the throttle position switch. Connect the speed and reference sensor mounting bracket to the back of the intake manifold. Connect all vacuum hoses to the intake manifold. Install the oil dipstick tube to intake manifold mounting bolt. On turbocharged cars, install the pipe between the intercooler outlet and the throttle body. On normally aspirated cars, install the air intake hose between the air flow sensor and the throttle body. Using FUEL-02, install the fuel rail and injectors. Route and connect the spark plug wires as the fuel rail is being installed. Check for leaks as described in FUEL-02.

The primary jacking point is located at the center of the rocker panels as indicated by the diamond-shaped indent at the base of the rocker. This jacking point will raise both wheels on that side of the car of the ground at the same time. Several years ago, at someone's recommendation, I started using a solid rubber hockey puck between the jack pad and that jacking point which works very well. However, depending on the lowered height of your floor jack and the ride height of your car, you may not be able to slide the jack under the car with a hockey puck on top of the pad. In fact, if your car is low enough, you may have difficulty getting the floor jack under the rockers at all. If that is the case, you may be forced to roll the wheels on to boards to raise the vehicle enough for a floor jack. This center jacking point is the best place to raise the vehicle when placing it on jack stands. With regards to other jacking points, there are two round pads behind the front wheel wells that appear to be jacking points. I have used these points for years with great success. However, many 944 owners claim that these are not jacking points and have experienced bending of the floor pan when trying to use these points. You can use the points safely provided the load isn't concentrated too much on that jacking point or the pad on your jack doesn't contact the area around the pad at all. If you have a jack with an oversize pad area it will contact the area around that jacking point. However, if you use a small block of wood or hockey puck between the jacking point and the pad on the jack or jack stand will prevent the pad from contacting the area around the jacking point and will distribute the load more evenly across the pad. You can also place the jack or jack stand on the frame rail or on the front suspension cross member. However, if the cross-member is to be removed for maintenance or repairs the cross-member is not an option. The rear jacking points are along the bottom edge of the rocker panels just in front of the rear wheel wells. These points work well for most repairs. However, if the engine is to be removed, the car can become easily unbalanced and tilt toward the rear if these points are used. If the engine is to be removed it is better to place the jack stands on somewhere along the rear torsion tube assembly. On most vehicles there are also two round pads behind the rear wheels that may be used. However, unless you have a set of very tall jack stands, they may not provide enough height to work effectively under the vehicle. There are two other points behind the rear wheels on the frame rail that appear to be jacking points. However, I've never tried to use them and I'm not positive they exist on all 944 models. To place a 944 on jack stands: Using a floor jack on the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels, raise one side of the vehicle to the desired height. Place jack stands under the front and rear jacking points to be used on that side. Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered. Use extreme caution as this is probably one of the most dangerous operations you will perform while working on your car. Once the car is securely on the jack stands, lower the jack the rest of the way and move to the other side of the vehicle. Again, using the center jacking point raise the vehicle to the desired height. Make sure that as the car is jacked it is balanced on the jack as it leaves the ground. Place the jack stands into position under the jacking points to be used on that side of the vehicle. Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered. When the car is securely in position on the jack stands, the jack may be lowered the rest of the way. To remove a 944 from jack stands: Raise the jack into position under the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels. When the weight of the car is removed from the jack stands remove them from under the vehicle. Very slowly, lower that side of the vehicle to the ground. Use extreme caution when lowering the vehicle. If it is lowered too quickly, you may dislodge it from the jack stands on the other side of the vehicle causing damage to the car or injuring yourself. Move the jack to the other side of the vehicle and repeat.

Required Every 7500 miles / 12000 km Change Engine Oil and Filter (Turbo Engines Only) Note:While Porsche recommends a 7500 mile oil change interval for Turbos and a 15000 mile oil change interval for normally aspirated cars, I feel that shorter oil change intervals are important to the longevity of the engine (bearings, rings, valve train). Personally, I change the oil and filter every 3000 miles (4800 km) and highly recommend that you choose an interval no longer than 5000 miles (8000 km). You should only use a Mahle oil filter with check valve or a Porsche OEM filter.

Check tension and condition of V-Belt (Power Steering) and Poly-Rib Belt (AC / Alternator) Replace Spark Plugs (At least every two years) Replace Air Filter Automatic Transmission: Change ATF, clean ATF strainer. Required Every 60000 miles / 96000 km Manual Transmission: Change Oil Automatic Transmission: Change Oil in Differential Other Required Maintenance Brake Fluid and Engine Coolant should be replaced every two years regardless of mileage. If the car is tracked, the brake fluid should be changed at least once a year. However, in some PCA regions, to pass a DE Event Tech Inspection, you must provide proof that your brake fluid has been changed within 3 months of the event. On 944s, the timing belt and balance shaft belt should be changed at 45,000 miles. For 968s, they should be changed at 60,000 miles. For both the 944 and 968, the belt condition and tension should be checked every 15000 miles. The 15,000 mile inspection interval assumes that the car has bee driven on a regular basis. If your timing belt is two years old and you have not reached the 15000 mile inspection interval, the timing belt tension and condition should be checked then and once per year after that. For 944s it is unusual for a water pump to last significantly past 100000 miles. For that reason, I recommend replacing the water pump at every other belt change (90000 miles). For 968s, it may be possible to extend the life of the pump to the second belt change at 120000 miles. However, you should monitor for indications of a failing water pump closely after 100000 miles. For timing belt and balance belt tensioners and rollers, I recommend removing the rollers and spinning by hand at each timing belt replacement. If the roller is noisy, it should be replaced. All rollers should be replaced at every other belt change unless it's an individual roller that was replaced during the previous belt change. For pre-1987 model 944s, the timing belt tension roller stud should be replaced at every other belt change.

The glass is held in place by three push pin connectors. The mirror glass can be easily broken if you pry to hard on the glass. Once the glass is separated from the drive mechanism, disconnect the heater wires from the back of the mirror and set the glass aside so it isn't accidentally broken. Using the appropriate size socket and ratchet, remove the three bolts that hold the mirror drive mechanism to the mirror housing. In the picture below this is shown using a mirror that has been removed from a car, but it works the same with the mirror on the car. When you have the drive mechanism separated from the housing you'll find an electrical connector for the drive mechanism. Disconnect the mechanism and set it aside. If the mirror housing is to be removed from the car, you'll have to remove the electical connector plug from the wires so that the housing will slide over the wiring harness. To do this you'll need an electrical connector pin removal tool. This is available at Radio Shack or most electronic supply stores. Using the tool push the pins, one at a time, out of the plug. Rotate the mirror toward the front of the car and you'll find an Allen head bolt underneath the mirror housing. Remove the Allen head bolt and the mirror housing will slide off of the wiring harness. Procedure - Late Model 944s (1985.5 and Newer) NOTE The mirror glass is attached to the mirror housing via a bayonet style locking ring. The locking ring has several teeth, one of which has a tab that locks into the bayonet mount. The locking ring is disengaged by inserting a flat tip screwdriver into the teeth and pushing the handle of the screwdriver to the left as you face the mirror (which rotates the locking ring counter-clockwise). On the bottom side of the mirror near the center you'll find a small hole. Insert the small flat tip screwdriver into the hole and rotate the sliding locking ring (as described above) that holds the mirror glass in place. Remove the mirror glass from the housing, disconnect the wire (mirror heating from the back of the mirror, and set it aside. Remove the three bolts that hold the motor assembly in place and remove the motor. Mark the orientation of the wires in relation to the indent on the motor plug. This will make the installation of the mirror go much smoother. Using a pin removal tool, press the female pins out of the motor electrical connector. Turn the mirror housing on the base enough to expose the mounting screws. Remove the mounting screws and lift the mirror off the door.

Vibration at idle (assuming balance shafts are properly aligned). Vibration will usually decrease noticeably or disappear when engine rpm is increased to around 1500 rpm. Visual inspection reveals cracking, gouging, or peeling of the rubber in the mounts. Excessive wear may also rupture the mount resulting is fluid leak from the mount. When the mount is removed from the car, the height between bearing surfaces is less than 65mm. The spec for a new mount is 70+/- 1 mm. The height between bearing surfaces on an installed mount should not be less than 60 mm. Tip from the 944 FAQ - The height of an installed mount may be checked by bending a heavy piece of wire into a &quot; [ &quot; shape with the points 60 mm apart. Use the wire to measure the height of the motor mount between the load bearing surfaces. If the height is less than 60 mm, the mount should be replaced.

Procedure Loosen the lug nuts on the front wheels several turns. Place the car on jack stands. Remove the front wheels. Remove the belly pan. Remove the front sway bar. Remove the motor mount heat shields. (M6 bolt, 10 mm socket) Remove the lower motor mount lock nuts. (M6 bolt, 17 mm open end wrench) Remove the upper motor mount bolts. These are difficult to get to. Use a flex head ratchet and 13 mm socket or a short 13 mm wrench. If the old mounts are the full rubber mounts, you will need another 13 mm wrench to hold the nut on the bottom of the mount. Place a block of wood on the pad for the floor jack (to provide a cushion). Jack up the engine on the oil pan to remove the tension on the motor mounts. Use a sharp object to scribe a mark around the cross-member mounting bolts (4 per side). Support the engine under the oil pan using a floor jack and a piece of plywood (as a jacking pad). The piece of plywood should be large enough to evenly distribute the weight of the engine over a good size area. I normally use a 12&quot; x 12&quot; piece of plywood. Jack the engine up just enough to remove most of the weight from the motor mounts. Loosen the cross-member mounting bolts (19 mm) until they are nearly removed. The easiest way to do this is to completely remove them one at a time and then thread them back in two turns. Between jacking the engine up slightly and lowering the cross-member by loosening the cross-member bolts, this should give you enough room to slide the old motor mounts out. However, you may need to use a pry bar to raise one side of the engine enough to slide the old motor mount out and the new mount in. You will have to twist the mount to get it out as part of the mount inserts into a pocket in the side of the cross-member. Before you install the new mounts, you may want to chase the threads in the mounting bolt holes of the new motor mounts with an M8 tap (i.e. retap the holes). In recent years there have been instances with OE mounts where the threads in the mounting bolt holes where not cut deep enough. This causes the threads in the holes to strip during mounting bolt installation. The right side motor mount uses two of the M8 x 38 mm bolts and standard thickness washers. The old spacer washers (if your car still has them) are not used with the new style motor mounts. Install the right side mounting bolts and washers. To determine the correct length bolt for the left side, measure the thickness of the ledge at the bottom of the left-side mounting bracket where the mounting bolt holes penetrate. If the ledge is 21 mm thick, you will need two 8 x M38 mm bolts. If the ledge is 25 mm thick, you will need two M8 x 42 mm bolts. Install the appropriate bolts with washers. The length of the bolts is important because if you use a bolt that is too long it will damage the new motor mount. Installation is the reverse of removal.

Regardless of what you call it, there are time that it may be necessary to remove it. The panel must be removed to replace the Porsche crest. On 944 Turbos, the panel must be removed to access the intercooler. And, on the 944 S2, the panel must be removed to replace the air filter. This procedure covers the removal and installation of the nose or header panel on 924s and 944s. On early model 944s, the nose panel is spot welded in place. To remove the nose panel on these cars, the spot welds must be drilled out. To reinstall the nose panel, it can be reattached using fasteners similar to the late model cars. Tools Phillips Head Screwdriver 1/4&quot; Drive 10mm socket 1/4&quot; Drive 8mm socket 1/4&quot; Drive Short Extension (2 inches) 1/4&quot; Drive Ratchet 1/4&quot; Drive Universal Adapter Removal Turn the ignition switch ON. Turn the headlight switch to the ON position to raise the headlights (you'll be leaving them in the raised position). Remove the fuse for the head lamp motor: Early 944s (pre-1985.5) - Fuse 1 Additional Fuse Panel Late 944s - Fuse 2 on Central Electric Panel Turn the ignition switch OFF. If so desired, you can raise the headlamps by removing the fuse listed above and raising the headlights manually using the knurled knob on top of the headlamp motor. On the early 944s and early 924s, remove the header panel by drilling through all off the spot welds that hold the header panel to the body. On late model 944s, remove the header panel as follows: Remove the four Phillips head screws along the back edge of the panel. Loosen the retaining nuts (8mm) in the bottom of the headlight bucket (2 in each headlight bucket). The nuts do not have to be removed completely. They need only be loosened. There is a machine screw located under the front lip of the nose panel in each headlight bucket area. Remove the machine screw under the lip of the nose panel using a 10mm socket, universal, 2 inch extension, and ratchet. A 1/4&quot; Drive 10mm socket is small enough to fit under the lip of the nose panel. Lift up on the back edge of the panel and side it toward the front of the car to remove. Installation If the header panel was removed on an early 944 or early 924, reattach the panel by using fasteners similar to the late 944s (see removal pictures). Slide the nose panel into place into the headlight buckets. Ensure the washers on the nose panel studs are on top of the bottom panel of the headlight bucket. Install the machine screw under the front lip of the nose panel. Install the four Phillips head screws along the back edge of the panel. Tighten the 8mm retaining nuts in the bottom of each headlight bucket.

You should never do this. Make sure that the car comes to a complete stop before resetting the trip odometer. There is very little difference between early and late model gauges when it comes to odometer repair. The primary difference is the gauge removal itself and getting to the internals of the speedometer to repair the odometer. Where there are differences they will be discussed in the body of this procedure. Procedure Remove the instrument cluster as described in ELECT-07, &quot;Removing Late 944 (1985.5 and newer) Gauge Cluster&quot; OR ELECT-06, &quot;Removing Early 944 Gauges&quot; For early model 944s (pre-1985.5) perform the following: Remove the speedometer from the instrument cluster by pushing on the back of the speedometer to push it out of the front of the cluster. Remove the bezel from the front of the speedometer by prying up on the bezel's back lip with a small flat tip screwdriver. Work around the circumference of the lip until the bezel is free from the unit. There are several screws on the back of the housing which need to be removed. Once they have been removed the speedometer internals will slide out of the housing. For late model 944s (1985.5 or newer) perform the following: Remove the gauge cluster front cover by removing the nine Phillips head screws located along the back edge of the cluster. Remove the four screws on the back of the instrument cluster directly behind the speedometer. This will allow you to remove the speedometer from the gauge cluster chassis. From here on the repair for both early and late model cars is the same. Hold the speedometer facing away from you and look at the left side for a worm gear. For those of you who don't know what a worm gear is, it looks like a white plastic screw. There should be a gear which engages this worm gear to drive the odometer. In all likelihood this gear has slid along the axis of it's shaft and has become disengaged from the worm gear, is worn to the point that it's teeth don't effectively engage the worm gear anymore, or is broken altogether. If the gear has simply slid off the worm gear, use a small flat tip screwdriver to move it back along the shaft until it is engaged with the worm gear. place a drop of Crazy glue on the shaft where it penetrates the gear to keep it from sliding on the shaft in the future. If your gear isn't broken or worn, you've completed the repair and may reassemble the gauge cluster. If the gear is worn or broken, further disassembly of the speedometer is required to replace the gear. If you don't feel comfortable going further with the disassembly, you may send the speedometer off to have it repaired. I recommend sending it to North Hollywood Speedometer or you may contact VDO to find an authorized repair facility near you.

Winchester, VA 22603 540-665-0110 At one time, you could send gauges directly to VDO for repair. Apparently, you now have to go through one of their authorized repair facilities (i.e. NHS is an authorized repair facility). If you wish to replace the gear yourself you'll first need to obtain a new gear. You may obtain a gear by contacting KLA Industries or Odometer Gears, Ltd. (see Parts section at beginning of procedure) or contacting an authorized VDO repair facility. You'll also find a very good gear replacement procedure with pictures on the KLA web site. Most 1985.5 and newer US model 944s use 20 x 21 tooth gear. However, in some instances you'll find they use a 20 x 22 tooth gear. Early US 944s use a 17 tooth gear and 968s use a 15 tooth gear. Odometer Gear Selector Model Odometer Type Gear Type (# Teeth) 1982-1985 944 USA Mechanical 17 1985.5-On 944 USA Electronic 20 x 21* 1985.5-On 944 USA Electronic 20 x 22* 911 USA Electronic 20 x 30 968 All Mechanical 15 * Most 944s with electronic speedometers/odometers use a 20 x 21 tooth odometer gear. However, a small number of 944s use a 20 x 22 tooth gear. You will have to disassemble the speedometer first to determine exactly which gear you need. If the gear has been destroyed to the point it is impossible to determine the number of gear teeth, you may have to purchase two gears and experiment with each to determine the correct gear for your particular car. After you obtained the replacement gear, you'll need to disassemble the speedometer to replace the gear. If the speedometer has a mechanical stop (pin) at 0 mph (early 944 gauges), gently lift up the needle on the speedometer over the mechanical stop and allow it to fully release and come to a stop. Mark the full stop position on the gauge face using a pencil or other marking tool which is easily removed when the speedometer is reassembled. If your speedometer does not have a mechanical stop, proceed to the next step. Gently pry up on the speedometer needle to remove it from its shaft. Remove the two screws that hold the face plate on the speedometer. Under the face plate you'll find four screws which you'll need to remove to separate the two halves of the speedometer. Once the speedometer halves are separated, you'll have access to the gears for the odometer. You'll have to remove most of the gears to get down to the one which needs to be replaced. The first gear to be removed is the furthest away from the gear to be replaced. It is held in place by a pin which can be pushed out with a small jeweler's screwdriver or small paper clip. The remaining gears are held in place by small e-clips which are easily removed (of course getting them back on is always a little more difficult). When you get the bad gear replaced, assembly is just the reverse of disassembly.

Procedure Place the vehicle on jack stands. Remove the belly pan. Disconnect the exhaust headers (13mm socket and ratchet and 13 mm combination wrench) and move them back out of the way. Although it does simplify matters, they do not have to be removed completely from the vehicle. Remove the oil filter. Disconnect the wires from the oil pressure sending unit. Using the thin head 24mm open end wrench, remove the oil pressure sending unit. Remove the oil pressure relief valve. If your vehicle has an external oil cooler disconnect the oil cooler supply and return lines from the oil cooler housing. Using COOL-02, drain the coolant from the vehicle. Using a 10mm socket and ratchet or 10mm combination wrench remove the heat shield above the oil cooler housing. NOTE You may find it necessary to remove the power steering pump. Remove the pump from the mounting bracket, leave the lines connected, and hang the pump out of the way. Using a 13mm socket and ratchet or 13mm combination wrench, remove the bolts for the oil cooler housing. Remove the oil cooler housing and the cooler element (for cars with integral oil cooler). When you remove the cooler and housing, the seals may remain attached to the cooler housing or to the block mating surface. NOTE There are actually two different styles of seal arrangement. In some cases you find three separate seals. However, you may also find a single gasket that has all three seals build in as an integral part of the gasket. The arrows in the picture above show the location of the three seals. The arrangement with three separate seals is the old style arrangement and has been replaced by a single integral seal. Remove all of the old seals from the cooler housing, block, and cooler element. On normally aspirated cars, replace the two o-ring seals on both nozzles for the cooler (999 707 043 40). On normally aspirated cars, install the plastic washer (944 107 154 00) between the cooler element and cooler housing and slide the element into the housing. OIL COOLER ASSEMBLY Lay a straight edge across the top of the cooler housing next to the cooler element guide boss and determine the distance between the lip of the boss on the cooler element (see picture below) and the straight edge. The distance should be 0 +/- 0.25 mm. Do NOT install the cooler housing gasket before taking the measurement. Install shims (944 107 219 00) as necessary to obtain the required measurement. Shim thickness is 0.5 mm. Normally no more than one shim is required. On normally aspirated cars, replace the cooler element rubber mount (944 107 153 02) in the groove on the block. Apply a coat of light grease to the ring to hold it in place on the block during assembly. On normally aspirated and turbocharged cars, install a new gasket (944 107 147 03) on the block. Some gasket sets are still showing up with three separate seals instead of one integral gasket. In either case, use a coat of light grease to hold the gasket/seals in place while mounting the cooler assembly. On turbocharged cars install a new o-ring on the connector pipe for the oil filter/thermostat housing (999 707 043 40). Bolt the assembled oil cooler (or filter housing on turbocharged cars) to the block. Do not fully tighten mounting bolts yet. Determine the correct oil pressure relief alignment tool. (See TOOLS above and Oil Pressure Relief Information procedure). Insert the tool into the vacant opening for the oil pressure relief valve to align the housing. Torque the oil cooler housing bolts (M8) to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Remove the alignment tool and install the oil pressure relief valve. Torque the relief valve to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Install the oil pressure sending unit and tighten to 35 Nm (26 ft-lbs). Reconnect the electrical wires for the oil pressure sending unit. Install the heat shield above the oil cooler housing. Torque the heat shield bolts (M6) to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs). Apply a light coat of oil to the seal of a new oil filter and install filter. Tighten filter to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Install the exhaust headers. If the cooler seal failure was evidenced by a &quot;milkshake&quot; solution in the coolant reservoir, flush the cooling system thoroughly. After flushing, fill and vent the cooling system using COOL-02. If there is reason to believe that coolant may have entered the oil system, change the oil, run the engine until it is warm, then, change the oil and install a new filter.

On the surface, replacing the oil pan gasket seems like such a simple job. However, it requires dropping the front suspension cross-member which requires the engine to be supported from above. In addition, on turbocharged cars, the cross-over pipe must be removed which requires removing the intake manifold. When you replace the oil pan gasket, it's also a great time to replace the rod bearings. You can figure on about 8-10 hours to replace the gasket on a normally-aspirated 944 and 12-14 hours for a turbocharged car. Porsche recommends in a Technical Bulletin (# 9005), that Silastic RTV 730 sealant be applied to the inside and outside corners of the oil pan gasket. Silastic 730 is good for high temperature applications and does not beak down in an oil environment. However, it is also brutally expensive. A tube typically runs over $100 USD. So, I typically use some other type of sealant in place of the Silastic 730. I normally use Permatex Ultra Grey sealant which is an oil and fuel resistant sealant. A Porsche mechanic friend of mine has never applied any type of sealant to the pan gasket and has never had one come back early with an oil pan gasket leak. The point here is, use the correct sealant or don't use anything at all. Tools Metric wrench set Metric socket set Silastic 730 RTV (000 043 019 00) or suitable replacement Floor Jack Jack Stands Engine Hoist, Factory Engine Support (VW 10-220 or VW 10-220A), or suitable replacement Tie Rod Separator Catch rags Catch pan Torque Wrench NOTE If you do not have access to an engine hoist and don't want to spend the money on the factory engine support tool, it is possible to fabricate your own tool to support the engine from above.

Place the vehicle on jack stands. Drain the oil from the pan. On turbocharged cars perform the following: Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. Using FUEL-09, remove the intake manifold. Using the applicable section of EXH-01, remove the turbo cross-over pipe. Remove the front stabilizer bar assembly-to-chassis (drop link) bolts and control arm bolts and remove the stabilizer from the vehicle. Disconnect the steering tie rod ends. Personally, I prefer a &quot;gear puller&quot; type separator as opposed to the &quot;fork/splitter type&quot; separator. It is much easier to disconnect the tie rod ends without damaging the boots using the gear puller type separator. Place alignment marks on the splined input shaft on the steering rack and the universal joint on the steering shaft so they can be assembled in the same orientation on installation. ( A punch and hammer or brightly colored finger nail polish will work fine.) Disconnect the steering gear shaft using a punch and hammer. Be careful not to damage the splines on the steering shaft. Remove the bolts that attach the suspension control arms to the chassis. Disconnect the ball joints that hold the steering knuckles to the control arms. Remove the bolts in the top of the motor mounts that hold the motor mount to the motor mount bracket. If you have power steering, disconnect the lines for the power steering rack at the power steering pump. Have a catch pan and catch rags ready to collect any power steering fluid that drains from the pump and lines. I also recommend wearing gloves when disconnecting the lines. Power steering fluid tends to irritate the skin of some folks. Support the cross member using a floor jack and a piece of wood. Support the engine from above using the appropriate tool (described in tool section). Remove the four cross-member to body bolts. Leave the steering rack and stabilizer bar attached to the cross-member and lower the entire assembly (including the control arms) from the vehicle. This should clear enough stuff out of the way to remove the oil pan. Remove the 22 oil pan retaining bolts (10 mm). Remove the oil pan from the vehicle. This may require a small pry tool to loosen the oil pan from the bottom of the crankcase. If you are going to replace the rod bearings now is a good time to do that. As a minimum, you should inspect the inside of the crankcase from underneath the vehicle for obvious signs of damage. Check the oil pickup tube to make sure it is completely intact (no cracks in the tubes), that it is firmly mounted, and clean any debris from the screen at the bottom of the tube. Clean and inspect the oil pan. Remove any debris from the pan and determine if the debris in the pan indicates damage to the engine / bearings (i.e. metal filings, etc.). Remove the old oil pan gasket from the pan and install the new gasket onto the pan. Apply appropriate sealant to the corner areas of the oil pan gasket (refer to the discussion on sealants found in the Introduction section). I found it much easier to install the pan when I applied a small amount of adhesive in various locations around the outside edge of the gasket to hold it in place while installing the pan. I used 3M Trim Adhesive. However, DO NOT USE too much adhesive and only apply it to the very outside edge of the gasket or it will interfere with the gaskets sealing ability. NOTE In order to ensure a proper seal on the oil pan gasket, it is imperative that the torque specs and torquing sequence for the oil pan bolts be strictly adhered to. DO NOT overtorque the oil pan bolts. Install the pan onto the crankcase using the mounting bolts but, do no fully tighten the bolts. Once all the bolts are installed tighten them using the torque specs and sequence shown below: Step 1 - Install bolts Step 2 - 4 Nm (3 ft-lbs) Step 3 - 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) Install the steering rack and cross-member assembly. As you raise the cross-member into position under the oil pan, ensure the motor mounts align with the motor mount brackets and install the motor mount bolts (M8). Also, align the steering linkage with the splines on the steering rack (using the alignment marks made during the removal) as the cross-member is being raised into position. When the cross-member is fully raised into position, install the four cross-member bolts (M12) and torque (19 mm socket) to 85 Nm (63 ft-lbs). Torque the motor mount bolts (13 mm socket) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). Install and tighten the bolt that holds the steering linkage to steering rack splined shaft. Reattach the hoses from the power steering rack to the power steering pump. Install the control arm-to-chassis bolts (M10) and torque to 46 Nm (34 ft-lbs). Attach the control arm ball joints (M10) to the steering knuckles and torque the lock nuts to 50 Nm (37 ft-lbs) . Install the front stabilizer bar. Torque the stabilizer linkage-to-body bolts (M8) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). If you have steel control arms, torque the stabilizer-to-control arm locknuts (M8) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). If you have aluminum control arms torque the stabilizer-to-control arm locknuts to 25 Nm (18 ft-lbs). On turbocharged cars perform the following: Using the applicable section of EXH-01, install the turbo cross-over pipe. Using FUEL-09, install the intake manifold.

It will gradually decrease to 2-3 bar at idle as the engine oil warms to normal operating temperature. Once the oil is at normal operating temperature, the oil pressure should indicate around 4 bar at 5,000 rpm. It takes the oil longer to reach its normal operating temperature than the coolant. Therefore, don't be surprised if oil pressure continues to decline after the coolant temperature has stabilized at its normal operating temperature. Occasionally, you may see your oil pressure drop to less than 2 bar. This may happen on very hot days when the car has been driven particularly hard. You should be extremely concerned if the oil pressure dropped to less than 1 bar. This is indicative of an problem with the oil pressure indication or the oiling system itself. Under these circumstances, the car should not be driven until the cause of the low oil pressure indication is determined and corrected. There are several things that may indicate a problem with the oil pressure indication. If your oil pressure is pegged high (5 bar) or won't indicate less than 4 bar at normal operating temperature, there is likely a problem with the oil pressure sending unit. Problems with the gauge itself and problems which cause the oil pressure indication to fail low are very rare. A low oil pressure normally indicates an actual problem with the oiling system. One of the problems which may cause low oil pressure is a failed oil pressure relief valve. Although I've never tried it myself, I've read reports from others who have removed the relief valve and turned the engine over to verify that oil comes out the hole for the relief. If oil comes out of the relief hole, this indicates a problem with the relief. If no oil or very little oil comes out, this normally indicates a problem with the pump itself. If a problem with the pump is indicated, check for proper tension on the crankshaft pulley bolt. The crankshaft bolt applies force to a spacer which in turn tensions a gear that drives the oil pump. If the crankshaft bolt is loose the gear will not turn the oil pump. Low or no oil pressure can also be caused by a broken oil pump pickup tube. This is normally caused by excessive vibration when the motor mounts are bad. The oil pan must be removed to replace the tube. If there is no oil pressure indicated when the car is started, the oil pump may have lost its prime. If this is the case, try removing the oil filter, pour oil down the center hole while rotating the crankshaft in the counter-clockwise to prime the oil pump. Then install a new oil filter. . Then start the car to see if you have oil pressure. Oil pressure which tracks normally but is lower than normal throughout the indicating range can indicate a leaking oil pressure relief valve or worn main and/or rod bearings.

Early 1987 924S used the spring and piston relief valve as well. Early 1987 engines which began production in July 1986 received a new one piece pressure relief valve. A one piece pressure relief valve was also produced as retrofit for the early three piece relieve valves. The part number for the retrofit relieve valve is 944 107 035 11. The part number for the early 1987 relief valve was 944 107 035 01. However, the early relief valves were not corrosion treated and were subject to failure. All 1987 engines produced from October 1986 on received a corrosion treatment which alleviated most of the failure problems. The table below lists 1987 engines by number and which relief valve they received. The early 1987 relief valves should be replaced during oil cooler seal repairs or at the first sign of oil pressure related problems. This valve was later replaced by a newer style one piece relief valve (944 107 035 02).

If you have a vehicle that uses an old style three piece relief valve, I recommend NOT replacing the old style valve unless it fails. In my opinion, the old style valve is just as reliable as the new style valve. The newer style valve is also a bit pricey. When replacing the relief valve it is important to ensure that you get the correct one piece relief valve for your particular vehicle. The two relief valves are of different lengths and are not interchangeable. The table below lists vehicles and part numbers for each relief valve.

One of the things that I don't particularly like about the new style relief valve is that oil cooler housing alignment is critical to prevent binding of the relief valve. To accomplish this an alignment tool should be used when the oil cooler housing is being installed. Cars which have relief valve 944 107 035 02 use special tool 9262/1. Cars which use relief valve 944 107 035 11 use special alignment tool 9215.

Place the car on jack stands. From underneath the car, remove all skid/belly pans which protects the bottom of the engine. NOTE On normally aspirated cars the power steering pump may not have to be removed to access the oil pressure sending unit. On turbocharged cars and normally aspirated 944s that have added external oil coolers, the addition of oil lines for the external oil cooler provides additional obstruction that requires the power steering pump be moved out of the way to access the oil pressure sending unit. Disconnect the power steering pump (leaving all lines attached) and hang it out of the way. Remove the belt tension adjusting turnbuckle without changing the adjustment and you will be able to reinstall the pump without having to adjust the belt. Disconnect the two wire leads to the oil pressure sending unit (located just below the oil filter). NOTE When you replace the unit, you should use a new crush washer on the sender. The Porsche PET nor the 944 Parts and Technical Reference Catalog show a crush washer on the sending unit. However, on every car I've ever replaced the sending unit, there was a crush washer. So, go to your local auto parts store and get an M18 x 24 (the important part is the M18) aluminum or copper crush washer. Using a 15/16&quot; or 24mm stubby open end wrench, loosen the oil pressure sending unit. Have some catch rags in place to catch any oil that drips out. Also, have the new sending unit ready to install to minimize the amount of oil that drips out. Remove the old sending unit and immediately insert the new one. Torque the sending unit to 35 Nm (25 ft-lbs). This will require a 24 mm (15/16&quot;) open ended crow's foot for your torque wrench. If you don't have one and don't want to go buy one, just make sure the sending unit is snug but, don't force it or you'll damage the seal ring. As long as you use a new seal ring, it shouldn't leak. Reconnect the wires to the terminals of the new sending unit. NOTE The sending unit has two terminals. Normally one is a straight post and the other is a post with a spaded connector on it. Sometimes the new sending units will come with spaded connections on both posts. Use the flat side of old sending unit as a reference to determine which post should have the spaded connector. If you get the terminals reversed, the gauge will be pegged high and the low oil pressure light will flicker on at idle. Once the wires are connected, reconnect the battery positive lead and start the car to verify proper operation of the oil pressure gauge. Reinstall belly pans and low car from jack stands.

There is a possibility that you may have an early oil pump on one of the later cars. I have a 1986 944 Turbo which had an original engine whose block was manufactured in 1985 and had an early oil pump. Procedure Place car on jack stands or ramps. Disconnect battery positive lead. Using ENG-13, set engine at TDC on cylinder number 1. Using ENG-03, remove the starter and install the flywheel lock (P9206). Using ENG-05, remove the balance shaft belt, timing belt, rollers, balance shaft sprockets, crankshaft gear, and rear timing cover. Remove the crankshaft gear Woodruff key from the crankshaft. If the oil pan is to be removed, refer to the applicable steps of LUBE-06 and remove the oil pan from the vehicle. Otherwise loosen/remove the oil pan retaining bolts as necessary to lower the front of the oil pan slightly. Remove the oil pump retaining bolts and slide the oil pump off the end of the crankshaft. Remove the oil pump drive gear from the pump. Inspect the drive gear closely. It will over time develop a ridge which will prevent proper sealing with the crankshaft oil seal. If a ridge is evident on the drive gear, it should be replaced. Remove the main oil pump seal from the oil pump housing. If the oil pump is to be disassembled for inspection prior to reusing, apply Loctite 574 to the outer edge of the pump insert during assembly. Install a new main seal in the oil pump housing and install the oil pump drive gear. Apply Loctite 574 to the sealing surfaces of the oil pump prior to installation on the block. Install the oil pump onto the block by sliding on to the end of the crankshaft and install the pump mounting bolts. Torque the M6 pump mounting bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) and the M10 bolt to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Install the crankshaft gear Woodruff key into the recess on the crankshaft. Using ENG-06 install the timing belt, balance shaft belt and all rollers. The belts are tensioned during the performance of ENG-06 using ENG-10. Install the air filter assembly ( AF-01). Reconnect battery. Install skid pan. Remove car from jack stands/ramps.

The DME then adjusts the amount of fuel to correct the mixture. The O2 sensor is also known as a Lambda sensor. When the DME is operating based on the feedback signal from the O2 sensor, this is referred to as Closed Loop operation. If the O2 sensor is faulty or is disconnected, the DME computer operates in Open Loop mode. In this case, the DME simply proves the fuel by determining the amount of air flow into the engine and selecting the appropriate amount of fuel from a set of preset fuel maps. On 944s which do not have O2 sensors (many ROW cars), the DME operates in Open Loop mode from preset fuel maps. For O2 sensors to operate correctly, they must be heated up to normal exhaust system temperature. There were two types of O2 sensors used on 944s. Early 944s used a single-wire O2 sensor which is simply heated by the engines exhaust up to normal operating temperature. The single wire provides output signal to the DME. Since it takes some time for the O2 sensor to get heated up, the DME operates in Open Loop until it reaches normal temperature. Later 944s use a three-wire O2 sensor (called a heated sensor) where there is one signal wire and two wire to provide power to the sensor to heat it up more rapidly. This reduces the amount of time that the DME operates in Open Loop before the sensor provides a good output signal. Generally, heated O2 sensors last about 60,000 miles and non-heated (single wire) sensors last about 30,000 miles. Porsche recommends replacing the O2 sensor every 60,000 miles but, does not differentiate between heated and non-heated sensors. Symptoms of a Bad O2 Sensor The following are some of the symptoms you might see if your O2 sensor is failing or has already failed: Engine surges or hesitates Strong smell of gas from the exhaust Poor fuel economy Failed emissions due to high CO or high HC levels Catalytic converter (if equipped) becomes prematurely clogged Testing the O2 Sensor Start the car and run until engine is at normal operating temperature. Disconnect the O2 sensor and connect a voltmeter to the sensor plug. Run the engine at approximately 2500 rpm. Introduce propane into the intake to enrich the mixture until the engine rpm drops by 200 rpm. You may be able to create the same affect by disconnecting the vacuum line to the fuel pressure regulator. However, you'll have to plug the vacuum line to prevent a vacuum leak to the intake manifold. If the voltmeter reading rapidly rises to greater than 0.9 VDC the O2 is correctly indicating a rich mixture. If the voltmeter response is sluggish or the voltage remains below 0.8 VDC, the sensor should be replaced. Secure the propane addition. While continuing to run the engine at 2500 rpm, disconnect a vacuum line from the intake to cause a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication rapidly drops to less than 0.2 VDC, the O2 sensor is properly reading a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication responds sluggishly or remains above 0.2 VDC, replace the sensor.

Or if you've order a sensor kit which comes with connectors, you'll have to install the connectors which come with the kit onto the new sensor wires. DO NOT solder the connectors onto the wires. They must be crimped on for the O2 sensor to work correctly. For the sensor to work correctly, it must draw clean air down to the sensor through the air gaps in the stranded wire. If you solder the wires, the solder will fill the air gaps in the wire and the sensor will not work correctly. Do not use any silicon based chemicals that could become exposed to the O2 sensor. Silicon will contaminate the sensor and it will quit working. Many RTV sealants, gasoline additives, and anti-seize compounds contain silicon so, check the label before you use it. Replacement First locate and disconnect the O2 connector plug. It will be a round connector plug at the back of the engine (unless it's been previously replaced with a universal sensor with plug kit). If necessary locate the sensor first and trace the wire up to the connector plug. After you've unplugged the sensor, locate the sensor and remove it using the appropriate size open ended wrench (or O2 sensor socket if you happen to have one). If you are installing a universal sensor, prepare the new sensor for installation by splicing the plug from the old factory sensor onto the new sensor wires. If it's a universal sensor kit which comes with connectors, install the new connectors on to the sensor wires and onto the factory wiring harness. Install the new sensor and tighten. Plug in the new sensor.

It's more intended to inform 944 owners as to what exactly it takes to PROPERLY paint a 944. I've seen many unhappy 944 owners due to botched paint jobs performed by otherwise very competent body shops. The problem that occurs is that shops that don't have a lot of experience with 944s simply don't understand everything involved in painting a 944 and therefore grossly underestimate the cost of the job. Hopefully this article will provide you with enough information to ensure that the shop you're using understands how to paint a 944 or that you can provide instructions to your body shop as to how your car should be painted. Preparation Just like painting any other vehicle, ninety percent of ensuring a quality paint job on a 944 is in the preparation. However, to properly paint a 944, the preparation can get pretty involved. There are a lot of body parts on a 944 which must be removed and painted while of the car for professional results. Therefore, the painting process can become pretty labor intensive. Expect a quality paint job to run anywhere from $2500 - 4000 depending on location. Every shop approaches painting a 944 differently. What I'm going to describe is how my car was painted. Quite honestly, I don't know how the shop could have been more thorough. Let's start with the front of the vehicle. The headlight covers should be removed as well as the nose panel. That is of course assuming the nose panel is removable. I realize that on 924s and early 944s the panel isn't removable and must be painted on the car. Also remove all the ground effects in the front of the car and paint them off of the car. On normally aspirated 944s, that means removing the front spoiler and front bumper. Remove the lights and bumper pads from the front bumper. On cars with the turbo front end, remove the fog lights and remove the front bumper cover. On all cars, remove the side mark lights. Moving on back on the car, remove the mirrors and door handles. Also remove the trim pieces on the roof. Remove the sunroof and all of the seals in the sunroof area. Paint the sunroof off of the car. At the rear of the vehicle, remove the hatch from the car. Remove the tail lights, license plate assembly, bumper cover, ground effects, and side markers. After all of the necessary parts have been removed the car and all removed parts should be sanded, all dents and dings repaired, and primed. To ensure a perfect painting surface, the car should be &quot;blocked&quot; after priming. You're body shop will know what that means. Basically, it's a process where a second coat of primer is applied of a different color. The body is then hand sanded. As the top color is sanded off, the base color with show through unevenly if the surface isn't level. These areas can then be leveled before painting. This concludes the preparation. I know it may seem a bit overwhelming. However, the outcome of the job is all in the preparation. Once the painted surfaces are properly prepared, the painting is relatively simple.

As always, procedures submitted by other owners are always welcome. Thanks Erik. Foreword by Author I just recently did this work. In my case, the two hoses that connect to the reservoir were old and leaking, as well as the power steering pump. From what I've learned talking to the experts at the shop, it's a fairly common problem with 944s. Are you sure that the reservoir is the part that's leaking? It would seem to me that the hoses have more of a history of leaking rather than the reservoir, as it's a single, solid, plastic part, and not prone to leaking. A DIY mechanic should be able to do the work with little problem (depending on how small and nimble yours hands are), provided that you have the needed tools and needed spare parts. You'll have to make sure that you get the right hoses, as these part numbers are for a my 944, and not a turbo. Here is a picture from the PET CD: Getting short hose in place (#26) is really easy. The harder one is the longer one (#39) is harder. The hardest part is to get the clamp on way up the fender well back on. I managed with a slight tap with a hammer on the mounting clip. Another thing to note is that it's easier to have everything connected loosely so that you can wiggle on all the connections that you need to make before tightening everything down and restricting movement. Procedure Remove lower plastic splash guards (have to do this any time that you want access to the bottom 1/2 of the engine). Remove the right front plastic inner fender cover, so you'll have better access. Remove clamp on hose #26 down by the pump. Be ready to catch the ATF that will be coming out. Loosen the two pump pivot bolts that attach the pump to the engine. Loosen the pump side of the belt tensioning bracket, and then remove the pump belt from the pump. Once the ATF has drained out, loosen the two reservoir clamps and remove the two hoses. Remove the reservoir from the car for a throughout clearing with mineral spirits, and lastly, soap water and a through hot water rinse. Set aside and let dry completely before re-installation. Loosen and remove the pump bolts and the pump by letting it swing down. Remove all the parts on the old pump that you will need to put on your new pump. Fish out hose #39, as well as hose #26 being sure to remove all the mounting clamps that you can find. Replace house #39 first, as it's harder, and then hose #26, make sure to have the hose clamps and mounting clamps back on where you'll need them. Mount all the parts on the new pump. Bolt #8 is a strange one. You need to make sure that it's very tight otherwise, the power steering fluid will leak out. Remount the pump. Connect the hoses to the pump. Connect the pump belt and tensioner. You should still be able to have a 1/4&quot; deflection on the belt, so it's not too tight. Tighten all the hose connections and the hose mounting clamps, including the ones to the reservoir. Tighten the reservoir mounting down. Fill with ATF Dexron as specified by the owner's manual. Idle engine and watch the fluid level drop, add fluid as needed. While idling, turn the steering wheel back and forth to work out any air in the system. Add fluid as needed. Inspect for leaks, and re-tighten hose clamps as needed. Once all the leaks are gone, lower the car so that there is some weight on the front wheels. Turn the steering wheel back and forth again while weight is on the front tires to stress the power steering a little bit. Raise the car, and inspect for leaks, and re-tighten hose clamps as needed. Remount the plastic fender inner liner as well as the plastic splash guards again.

I'd like to thank Doc for taking the time to write this procedure and take pictures to go along with it. Foreword by Author The following details how I resealed my power steering rack. A seal kit can be gotten from Travis at www.rennbay.com for about 70 bucks. A rebuilt rack can be acquired for 225-250 with core exchange, so if you want to try and reseal yourself and save some money, you can find instructions here, on Rennbay's site, and also on www.arnnworx.com. Doc Wilen Tools Good selection of metric sockets and a few long extensions for removing and replacing the wiper seals. A small pick (dental pick is ideal) Hammer, punch Reseal Kit Needle nose pliers Allen key for removing the hard lines (6mm) Other Procedures Needed STEER-01, Power Steering Rack Replacement Procedure Using STEER-01, remove the steering rack from the vehicle. Have a large CLEAN workspace with a lot of clean rags or a roll of paper towels or both. Lay out the seal kit on a strip of paper towels, so you can easily match up the seals as you remove them from the rack. I found it easiest to remove one seal at a time, match it up, put the new one on the rack, and move on to the next one. When you remove an old seal and match it up, place it off to the side somewhere where it will not get mixed up with the new seals. On some o-rings it is hard to tell the old ones from the new ones if you are not careful. With the rack on the workbench, remove the hard lines using an Allen wrench. (I had to use a vise-grip on 1 bolt due to it being stripped. These can be on pretty tight. They need to come off, because there are 2 rubber o-rings per fitting that need to be replaced, for a total of 8 rubber o-rings. Using a punch and a hammer, removing the locking collar that holds the 2 halves of the rack together. It will just screw off. In the picture below, you can see the collar has been removed and slid back on the bronze tube. The bronze tube (steering sleeve) will then separate from the gray control tower. Note the hard lines had not been removed yet when this picture was taken. Remove rubber boot from the top of the control tower that surrounds the spindle, then remove the three 10mm bolts. You can then carefully pry the top off of the control tower. The top will have 1 wiper seal in it, and an o-ring as seen below. Note the orientation of the wiper seal before you remove it. The groove side will be on the inside of the tower, with the flat side pointing outward. Grab the steering gear where the steering shaft normally attaches, and turn the gear counter clockwise while pulling up on the gear, the main unit will slide out of the control tower, also allowing the steering rod to be pulled from the control tower as well. The following picture will show all the pieces apart. The yellow arrow is the shuttle The red arrow is the steering rod The purple arrow is the steering gear The blue arrow is the control tower The gray arrow that is hard to see is the steering sleeve These are probably not the official names. The steering gear. Once removed from the control tower, make sure you keep the spacers and bearings lined up in the proper orientation. One the gear itself are 4 hard plastic rings (white). Underneath each is a standard rubber black o-ring. Remove these with a pick and replace them with the new seals. The left picture shows before, and the right picture shows them replaced. The new hard plastic rings are blue. The control tower: After you remove the steering gear, there is a wiper seal at the bottom that needs to be removed. This is a real pain in the butt to remove, because you can't get a socket behind it to hit it out. Destruction may be the only way to get it out, just make sure not to nick the edges of the control tower. Again the groove faces upwards as you are looking at the seal from the top. This is the HARDEST seal to get out of the rack. And it is a very important seal, as it keeps fluid from leaking out of the rack on the driver's side. Chances are you will nick the metal casing when trying to remove the seal, and if you do so, the rack will most likely leak when you get it back in the car. Then you get to drop the 250 for a rebuilt rack. On the passenger side of the control tower, there is a large o ring in a groove that needs to be replaced. The smaller one you see actually came off the end of the shuttle, and belongs next to the white spacer that sits on the outside of the shuttle. The steering shaft and shuttle. There is a shuttle that slides back and forth on the steering shaft itself. Inside the shuttle is a wiper seal and hard white rubber spacer. To remove the shuttle from the steering shaft, you must remove 2 snap rings, a couple of washers, and another seal mechanism. Again there is a hard white rubber ring on the outside of the seal mechanism, and a rubber o-ring underneath that. Also when you slide the washers off the shaft, there will be another 2 rubber o-rings underneath. Once all those are removed, the shuttle can be removed. You could also force the shuttle off over the teeth on the steering shaft, but you would not want to put on the shuttle in that direction due to possibly hurting the new wiper seal. In the picture below, the right picture shows the seal mechanism and the shuttle in place on the shaft. The shuttle is pushed all the way against the seal mechanism. In the left picture, half the seal mechanism is removed (there is still 1 washer and 1 snap ring on the shaft), and it shows the 2 o-rings underneath it. Again that blue plastic seal replaces the white seal that was originally on the unit. The shuttle. Remove the shuttle from the steering shaft. Inside is a wiper seal and a hard plastic spacer underneath it. Using the appropriate sized socket, pound the seal out of the shuttle, and install the new spacer and seal. Again the groove in the wiper seal will face out, or toward the passenger side of the vehicle. On the outside of the shuttle is a hard plastic ring, and a rubber o-ring that holds the ring onto the shaft. In the following picture, the plastic ring is on, but the o-ring is currently removed (it is actually seen in a previous picture if you read the description.) The o-ring will go on the outer side of the plastic ring (in the picture, to the right). The bronze steering sleeve. Inside is a wiper seal, a plastic spacer, and a plastic guide ring. The plastic guide ring is removed first, using a small pick and needle nose pliers. When I removed it, I thought I was going to break it, but it seemed to flex pretty easily and come out. Next, take the appropriate size socket and knock out the wiper seal and spacer. Note, the tube size steps down as it gets closer to the seal, so if you put the tightest fitting socket in the end of the sleeve and try to pound out the seal, you will be hitting on the sleeve itself, and the seal won't move. I had use a socket that was a little smaller. The seal came out in about 3 hits. Again the groove on the wiper seal will face towards the control tower, or drivers side of the vehicle. This is looking in from the long end of the tube. The seal will be hit from the opposite end, and come out towards you (as if you are looking at this current picture). You can see the groove in the seal. The white rubber spacer is behind the wiper seal. The above picture is misleading (not how it will come out of the sleeve), as the wiper seal is turned the wrong way, it should be flipped so that you are look at the back of the seal (flat side). That is about it for seals that need to be replaced, install everything in the opposite direction. Make sure you use the correct size socket to install the seals (and make sure they go in the right way, if they are installed the opposite direction, they will leak). Make sure you pound the seals in evenly. The seals went in pretty easily for me. Total time to replace the actual seals is probably an hour or 2 if you take your time. The pictures are kind of hard to understand if you haven't had your rack apart yet, but once you get it apart, everything is pretty simple. There really is no way to mix up the seals, as the sizes are all pretty different. The write up is not perfect yet, but should be able to help anyone currently trying this procedure.

Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes Park your vehicle in a suitable work space with a minimum of 1 meter clearance around the car. Apply the parking brake, open the driver's side window, block the rear wheels and disconnect the negative lead of the battery. Use your choice of 19mm wheel wrench and loosen the front wheel lug nuts just enough to allow easy removal after the tires are off the floor. Jack each side of the car sequentially at the designated jacking points and place jack stands under the frame rails in the vicinity of the jacking points. NOTE Obtain as much ground clearance as possible staying within the manufacturer's recommendations of your equipment. Approximately 18 inches worked fine for me. Remove the front wheels and set aside. (sounds like we're baking a cake!) Remove the 7 undercover panel (belly pan) bolts using a 3/8 drive ratchet and 10mm socket, and remove the undercover. With the car secure, place the catch basin under the power steering pump. Using a 19mm wrench, remove the pressure line from the pump, and allow the power steering fluid to drain into the basin. Turning the steering wheel lock to lock several times will help void the steering gear of fluid. (aren't you glad you opened the window?) Allow to drain completely. 2.0 - Front Sway Bar Removal Tools Needed: 13mm socket, 13mm wrench, 17mm wrench, 8 inch long 3/8&quot; drive extension, flat blade screwdriver. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes On the passenger side, use a 13mm socket and a 13mm wrench to remove the 2 clamp bolts holding the sway bar to the frame anchor. On the drivers side, use the 13mm socket on the extension to remove the 2 bolts attaching the sway bar frame anchor to the frame. Removal of the frame anchor provides working clearance for Step 3. Use the 17mm wrench to remove the nut attaching the sway bar to the control arm on each side, and remove the sway bar. With a screw driver, loosen the clamps on the alternator cool air intake tube and remove it also. You should now have a clear path to the steering gear shaft and universal joint clamp. 3.0 - Disconnect Tie Rod Ends Tools Needed: 19mm wrench, gear puller, (or &quot;pickle fork&quot; ) Estimated Time Required: 20 minutes On each side, use the 19mm wrench to loosen the locking nut on the tie-rod end ball joint. Turn off the nut until it is just slightly above the end of the stud. Use a small gear puller to disconnect the tie-rod end from the steering knuckle. TIP You may be able to get the tie rod ends to pop out by banging on the end of the steering knuckle, eliminating the need for a gear puller or pickle fork tool. This tip is provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. NOTE A pickle fork can be used however this almost always damages the ball joint rubber boot and should be avoided if the tie-rod end is to be reused. NOTE If your vehicle uses self locking nuts to secure the tie rod ends, (they have a rounded top and no washer of any kind or cotter pin is employed) I have been told that these must be replaced. The theory is they stretch after one use and are not reliable for reuse. I had zero success finding these locking nuts at any automotive store and substituted standard nuts with locking washers. 4.0 - Disconnect the Steering Column Lower Universal Joint Clamp from the Steering Gear Tools Needed: 13mm wrench, 13mm socket, 12 inch long 3/8 drive extension, short pry bar. Estimated Time Required: 15 minutes Turn the steering wheel until the universal clamp bolt head is in line with your access from under the car. Reach in behind the steering column to put a 13mm wrench on the nut and use the 13mm socket and extension to remove the clamp bolt. The clamp bolt must be completely removed before the universal can be removed from the steering gear. NOTE Some light pressure from a small pry bar ( or large screwdriver) should be sufficient to loosen the clamp from the shaft. The universal and clamp will not come all the way off until the steering gear unit is lowered. 5.0 - Rack Removal Tools Needed: 13mm wrench, 6mm Allen wrench. Estimated Time Required: 15 minutes Use the 6 mm Allen wrench to remove the return line from the steering gear housing of the rack. NOTE I understand some lucky individuals have hex-head hollow bolts. If you have the Allen head like mine and you're unfortunate, the hollow bolt attaching the line will have seized and you will need channel locks to remove it. TIP If you have the Allen head hollow bolts, you may want to consider replacing them with hollow hex head bolts which are available from the dealer. It makes it much easier to attach the return hose after the rack is in place as there is room between the rack and cross-member to tighten the bolt with an open end wrench. This tip provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. Remove the pressure line support clamp from the rack housing and the ground wire that is attached at that location. Then, with the 13mm wrench, remove the 4 rack mounting bolts. Slide the rack out of its mounting journals and simultaneously slip off the steering universal joint as you lower the rack assembly. Since your replacement rack is probably bare, you will need to remove the following items from your old rack for installation on the new rack: High pressure line support clamp and 10mm bolt Rack line rubber spacer Plastic compensating line with two plastic L-shaped fittings (they just pull out) Left and right side mounts 6.0 - Tie-rod Removal from the Rack Tools Needed: 3 inch vise, soft jaws, 30 mm wrench, cold chisel. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes Label the left and right tie-rod ends for re-assembly. Pull the boots away from the steering gear housing to expose the rack and inner ball joints of the tie-rod assembly. If your seals were blown as bad as mine, this is another opportunity to get a Dexron II bath! Extend the driver's side of the rack all the way out. This will expose approximately 75mm (3 inches) of rack teeth which should be clamped tightly into the soft jaws on the vise. I used two pieces of aluminum angle to make soft jaws. If you have a 4 inch vise, you will have to angle the rack in order to get a good grip on the flats of the rack teeth. NOTE Mounting the rack in the vise securely is an important step as it is imperative that no pressure be applied to the steering gear mechanism. At each end of the rack, there is a small locking notch (about 8mm) which should have the flange of the inner ball joint peened into it. Use the cold chisel to carefully remove the peened portion of the flange. Then, using a 30 mm wrench, or large crescent wrench, remove the tie-rod assemblies from the rack. Both ends are right hand thread, just in case you were wondering. You can now mail in the old rack and get your core charge back! 7.0 - Tie-rod Installation in the Rack Tools Needed: 3 inch vise, soft jaws, 30 mm wrench, flat nosed chisel (drift). Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes Place the new rack in the vise as described in Step 6 taking care not to remove or contaminate the new gear grease. Screw in the left and right tie-rod assemblies. By making sure the tie-rod assemblies are installed as labeled, your wheel alignment should be satisfactory for a short drive to the alignment shop. For power steering units, apply 52 ft-lbs of torque to each tie-rod assembly using the 30mm wrench. NOTE In lieu of the specialty Porsche torque wrench, a 50 pound pull scale can be used in conjunction with your favorite 30mm wrench. Simply divide the 52 ft-lbs. torque requirement by the distance from the center of the flange nut to the point at which you can anchor the pull scale. This value is the required measure of force which should be applied perpendicular to your wrench via the pull scale. Just pull on the scale until it reads the value you calculated. The odds are in your favor that an intact portion of the inner ball joint flange will be adjacent to the locking notch. Use a flat punch to peen the flange against the corners of the locking notch. Thread lock products are not recommended. Remove the rack from the vise and re-install the boots on the steering gear housing. 8.0 - Rack Installation Preparation Tools Needed: Same as removal. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes General Note: The manuals I've seen typically say &quot;Installation is done in the reverse order of removal.&quot; This is basically true, however it is simply not that easy in this case. Prior to installation, it is important to get all your original parts back on the new rack. The following assembly order worked for me: (See Photos 1 and 2) Slide right and left side mounts into place. Install rubber spacer under the rack line. Attach high pressure line using new bronze crush washers (torque to 15 ft-lbs) I tightened mine as tight as possible with a 6 inch long 6mm Allen wrench. Loosely attach support clamp with 10mm bolt. (you will have to remove it later) Insert the L-shaped fittings on the ends of the compensating line. Snake the compensating line into position and firmly push the fittings into place on the rack housing. 9.0 - Rack Installation Tools Needed: Same as removal plus optional 10x1x35mm bolt and a grinder. Estimated Time Required: 60 minutes First center the rack. This is done by removing the threaded plastic plug from the view port on the underside of the steering gear housing and turning the steering shaft until a red dimple in the rack gear is in alignment with the view port. (see photo No. 3) Once in alignment, thread a 10x1x35+/-mm bolt into the view port to lock the rack in the centered position. The bolt should have a smooth tapered end to engage the dimple. (fire up the grinder!) TIP Instead of fabricating a locking bolt with a tapered end, you may want to try inserting a ball bearing into the view port hole to engage the dimple and threading an unaltered bolt into the hole to lock the ball bearing in place. This tip is provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. With this accomplished, place the rack assembly into position on the passenger side of the car and finger tighten one of the passenger side mounting bolts. Allow the driver's side to hang down slightly. Next, reach in the window of the car and turn the steering wheel until it is straight. You may want to have and assistant hold the steering wheel straight for you. (my daughter did an excellent job!) At this point, the open side of the universal clamp should be in generally good alignment with the flat side of the steering gear shaft. Align the split in the clamp exactly in the center of the shaft flat. If you don't, the clamp bolt cannot be installed. With the steering column universal joint clamp positioned over the steering gear shaft, push the rack assembly up into position. The universal clamp will now slide down the steering gear shaft where it belongs. Install and hand tighten the upper driver's side mounting bolt. If the universal clamp did not side into position completely, use a small hammer and lightly tap it down until none of the flat is visible beneath the clamp. (believe it or not there is room to do this!) Install and tighten the clamp bolt. Install and finger tighten the remaining two mounting bolts. Getting the mounting bolts aligned and finger tightened is a bit of a chore but absolutely necessary to avoid cross threading the aluminum cross member. Tighten the rack mounting bolts to about 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). Install the high pressure line mounting clamp and ground wire. Attach the high pressure line to the power steering pump using new bronze crush washers. (torque to 33 ft-lbs) Attach the return line to the rack housing using new bronze crush washers. (torque to 15 ft-lbs.) Use a plastic tie wrap to bundle the high pressure line and compensating line to the rack. The wrap should be placed at the same location as the rubber rack line spacer. Remove your custom centering bolt (if you used one), then replace and tighten the view port plastic plug. Connect the tie rods to the steering knuckles tightening the locking nuts to about 30 ft-lbs. You will need to apply sufficient pressure to the tie rod end ball joint shaft to prevent it from turning in the knuckle. I used the same small puller I took them apart with and a flat &quot;cushion&quot; plate on the bottom of the tie rod end. Install the fresh air tube and the driver's side sway bar mounting bracket. Next, install the sway bar. This must be done by connecting the ends first. The sway bar to control arm mounting bolts should be tightened to 18 ft-lbs. Then using a jack, raise the sway bar until the mounting clamps are in alignment with mounting brackets. Be sure both sides go into the proper position simultaneously. Install the clamp bolts and tightened to 17 ft-lbs. 10.0 - Bleeding The System Tools Needed: NA Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes Install the wheels and lower the car off the jacks. Fill the power steering reservoir with Dexron II or III automatic transmission fluid. Reconnect the battery and start the car. Wait a few minutes to give the fluid time to find its way. Bleed the air from the new rack lines by slowly turning the steering lock to lock until no more air bubbles appear in the reservoir and the fluid level remains constant. As a final check, compare the fluid level in the reservoir with the engine stopped and with the engine running. If the fluid level rises more than 10mm, there is still air in the system and you should repeat the bleeding process. Once this is complete, you're back on the road and off to the alignment shop. Congratulations you just saved yourself $????? and learned something new as well. Drive safe.

Over time, the hatch seals tend to dry out and shrink. As a result, the hatch does not fit as tightly and it can rattle or squeak. If so, this can often be corrected by adjusting the two posts on the rear hatch. To adjust the posts, loosen the lock nut next to the hatch. To tighten the post, turn it clockwise several turns and then tighten down the lock nut. Be careful not to tighten the post to much or the hatch will difficult to latch and unlatch. Another possible cause is latch mechanism for the rear hatch. The latch mechanism needs to periodically lubricated. Use a good quality grease to lubricate the latch mechanisms on both sides. A combination of lubrication and adjusting the posts will often solve a squeaky hatch. Finally, the most difficult hatch repair is caused by the rear glass separating from the hatch frame. This is caused by repeatedly slamming the rear hatch. The vibration caused by slamming the hatch closed, over time, causes the glass to separate from the frame. That's why it's important to close the hatch by lowering it down against the hatch opening gently and then pushing down on the rear of the hatch to latch it. There are several schools of thought with regard to repairing the rear hatch. Many will tell you that the car must be taken to a professional glass service to be re-glued. While this does ensure a quality repair, it can also be very costly. There are others who have taken on this repair themselves and have successfully repaired the rear hatch. However, the hatch has to be removed from the car for repair. So, if you decide to do the repair yourself, you should have someone assist you during the removal and installation. Repairing Separated Glass Introduction There are a number of different sealants/adhesives that can be used to repair the rear hatch glass. The best ones are urethane based. Probably the best overall is 3M Window Weld Urethane Auto Glass Sealant. Procedure Remove the rear hatch as follows: Disconnect the rear window defroster wires (one on each side). Disconnect the rear hatch shocks. Lower the rear hatch but do not allow it to latch. You may place a piece of wood between the back of the hatch and the body to prevent the hatch from latching. From inside the car, remove the bolts that hold the rear hatch hinges to the body of the car (2 hinges - 2 bolts per hinge). On early cars, there's a cover over the hinges. On later cars, the rear header panel will have to be removed. Have someone assist you to lift the rear hatch off of the car. Remove the trim strips from around the edge of the hatch. You'll find clips that hold the strips in place. In most cases, the clips are accessed from the underside of the hatch. Work slowly and carefully to pry the frame off of the hatch glass. Scrapers usually work well for separating the glass from the frame. Using an adhesive remover and scraper, remove the remains of the old sealant. Reinstall the hatch frame onto the car with it in the closed position. Do not attach the hatch shocks yet. Make sure the hatch frame fits properly to the hatch seals. Over time the hatch frame may have become bent and may need to be bent to get a proper seal. Place a bead of sealant all the way around the hatch frame following the directions for the adhesive. Place the glass on to the frame and push down around the edges to make sure the glass makes good contact with the frame. Here's a good suggestion from Vaughn Scott for installing the glass. &quot;With the glass upside down, maneuver it so that it's behind the car with the rear edge facing forward. Place the rear edge of the glass in the rear of the frame and rotate it forward until the front of the glass is about a foot from being in place. Have one person hold it in place while the other person goes inside the car and takes the weight of the glass. Then the person outside of the car pulls their hands out of the way and the glass is lowered into place.&quot; Using the adhesive, fill in any gaps between the glass and the frame. Allow the adhesive to cure for at least 24 hours. Reinstall the trim strips and clips. This may require unbolting the hatch hinges. Attach the shocks to the hatch.

The early style gauge was used on all models of 924s and on 944s up to the 1985 model year. The later gauge was installed on 1985.5 and newer 944s and 968s. One of the difficult things about using a 924/944/968 coolant temperature gauge is that there are no real temperatures indicated on the gauge face. This can make it difficult to determine if the gauge, cooling system, or cooling fans are operating properly. It is therefore help to know what temperatures correspond to the markings on the gauge face. The diagrams below show those relationships. Temperatures are shown in degrees Celsius. Many times I hear folks ask &quot;what the normal coolant temperature for a 944?&quot; Well, it's a difficult question to answer because there are a number of factors which can effect coolant temperature. However, generally speaking, in cool to moderate climates (up to about 25 °C) driving on the highway, 944 coolant temperatures will normally run between 80-90 °C. Under these conditions, the system typically runs cool enough that the radiator cooling fans will not run. In warmer climates (25-35 °C) and in heavy traffic conditions with stop and go driving, coolant temperatures may run as high as 100 °C. The cooling fan(s) should come on at approximately 92 °C to reduce coolant temperature. If your coolant temperature consistently runs higher than 100 °C, it's time to start looking for problems. Realize that the problem could be an actual high temperature problem or it could be a problem with the temperature sensor or gauge. Time and time again, I hear folks complaining about the car's coolant temperature running significantly higher than normal. When I start talking to them, I frequently find that these symptoms occur after a round of performance modifications where they've increased the horsepower the engine is making. What is frequently overlooked is that when an engine makes more horsepower, it makes more heat and more heat is rejected to the cooling system. Since nothing has been done to increase the capacity of the cooling system, with the increase heat load the steady-state cooling temperatures are naturally going to run higher than before. This means that the cooling fans will run more frequently, run longer, and have a harder time reducing/maintaining coolant temperature in hot weather and in stop and go driving. Realize also that this also means higher steady-state oil temperatures, lower oil viscosity, and hence lower than normal steady-state oil pressures. Coolant Temperature Gauges Early 944 (Pre-1985.5), 924 Late 944 (1985.5 and Newer) The numbers in red on the early gauge were determined by FR Wilk through interpolating the Bosch sender curves. Testing Coolant Temperature Gauges Tools Multimeter Variable Resistance Potentiometer (Minimum 0-500 ohms) Test Leads Procedure Disconnect the two spade connector leads from the temperature gauge sensor. Using the appropriate table below, set the variable potentiometer to one of the resistances listed. Early 944s (pre-1985.5), 924 Temperature (°C) Resistance (Ohms) 40 287.4 105 33.6 120 22.7 Late 944s (1985.5 and Newer) Temperature (°C) Resistance (Ohms) 40 287.4 60 134.0 80 69.1 100 38.5 115 25.8 Connect the larger of the disconnected sensor leads to one terminal of the variable potentiometer being careful not to change the potentiometer setting. Connect the other terminal of the variable potentiometer to a grounding point in the engine compartment. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Check the temperature gauge reading compared to the required indication for the resistance on the variable potentiometer. Repeat as necessary for all temperature-resistance combinations in the table. If the gauge appears to be reading normally and you still suspect that the temperature readings are abnormal during engine operation, proceed to the temperature sensor testing procedure. If you determine that the gauge is bad, replace it or send it to an authorized VDO repair facility for service. Testing Oil Pressure Gauge Problems with the oil pressure indication are commonly caused by a failing oil pressure sending unit. Normally, at startup when the ignition switch is turned on, the oil pressure will indicate 5 bar. Upon starting the engine the oil pressure should indicate between 4.5 - 5 bar. As the engine heats up the oil pressure will gradually decrease until the oil reaches normal operating temperature. At that point the oil pressure will normally indicate around 2.5 - 3 bar. On very hot days the oil pressure could indicate as low as 2 bar. If the indication falls below 2 bar and remains consistently below 2 bar, it could indicate a problem with the main or rod bearings. Oil Pressure Gauge Testing Multimeter Variable Resistance Potentiometer (Minimum 0-500 ohms) Test Leads Disconnect the leads from the oil pressure sending unit. Using the multimeter and the variable potentiometer, set the potentiometer to one of the resistances listed in the appropriate table below for your vehicle. 1982-85 944 Oil Pressure (Bar) Resistance (Ohms) 0 10.0 3 116.0 5 184.0 1985.5 and Newer 944 Oil Pressure (Bar) Resistance (Ohms) 1 29.6 2 65.3 3 98.9 4 133.6 5 184.0 Connect the oil pressure sending unit lead which was removed from terminal &quot;G&quot; on sensor to one leg of the variable potentiometer. Connect the other leg of the variable potentiometer to a grounding point in the engine compartment. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Check the oil pressure gauge reading compared to the required indication for the resistance on the variable potentiometer. Repeat as necessary for all oil pressure-resistance combinations in the table. If the gauge appears to be reading normally during testing and abnormally during engine operation, there may be a problem with the oil pressure sending unit. If you don't have the resources to fabricate connections to apply an external pressure source to the sending unit, it may be necessary to simply replace the sending unit without testing. Testing Fuel Level Gauge Testing and repair for the fuel level indication is covered in ELECT-18, Fuel Level Indication Problems / Repairs. Air Flow Sensor (AFM) Testing The Air Flow Meter (AFM) testing section has been move to a stand-alone procedure which is more accurate and now includes instructions for cleaning and repairing erratic operation. For AFM testing, refer to ELECT-22. DME Temperature Sensor Testing Tools Multimeter Test Leads Procedure Turn the ignition switch OFF. Disconnect the DME computer electrical connector. Connect an ohmmeter between terminal 13 on the disconnected DME plug and ground. Check for the following resistances: DME Temperature Sensor Resistances 15-30 °C (59-86 °F) At 59 °F approximately 3.3 k-ohms At 86 °F approximately 1.46 k-ohms NOTE The next part of the DME temperature sensor testing assumes that the temperature gauge on the dash is working properly. Connect the DME plug connector. Start the car and run until the temperature gauge on the dash indicates approximately 80 °C (see dash temperature gauge section). If you suspect that the dash gauge is not working properly, you can check the surface temperature on the block near the DME temperature sensor. Turn the engine OFF. Disconnect the DME computer plug and connect ohmmeter as described in Step 3. Turn the ignition switch back ON (Do Not Attempt to Start Car) and check dash indication is still reading 80 °C. Alternatively, check the surface temperature on the block near the DME temperature sensor. Compare resistance to the value in the table below. DME Temperature Sensor Resistances 80 °C (176 °F) 280-360 ohms If the resistances don't meet the tolerances listed, the DME Temperature sensor should be replaced. If the resistances indicate higher than the specs, it will cause a richer mixture. Lower resistances than the specs will result in a lean mixture. Throttle Position Switch Testing Throttle Position Switch testing is covered in FUEL-06, Throttle Position Switch Information, Troubleshooting, Replacement, and Adjustment. Speed and Reference Sensor Testing Speed and Reference sensor testing is covered in IGN-02, Checking, Replacement, and Adjustment. Oxygen Sensor Testing Tools Multimeter Test Leads Propane Source Procedure Start the car and run until engine is at normal operating temperature. Disconnect the O2 sensor and connect a voltmeter to the sensor plug. Run the engine at approximately 2500 rpm. Introduce propane into the intake to enrich the mixture until the engine rpm drops by 200 rpm. You may be able to create the same affect by disconnecting the vacuum line to the fuel pressure regulator. However, you'll have to plug the vacuum line to prevent a vacuum leak to the intake manifold. If the voltmeter reading rapidly rises to greater than 0.9 VDC the O2 is correctly indicating a rich mixture. If the voltmeter response is sluggish or the voltage remains below 0.8 VDC, the sensor should be replaced. Secure the propane addition. While continuing to run the engine at 2500 rpm, disconnect a vacuum line from the intake to cause a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication rapidly drops to less than 0.2 VDC, the O2 sensor is properly reading a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication responds sluggishly or remains above 0.2 VDC, replace the sensor.

This procedure will describe how to test the sensors for proper operation. It will also describe how to replace and adjust the sensor clearance if they are bad. The sensors are located on the top of the clutch housing at the back of the engine. You can locate them by looking from the driver's side of the car (left-hand drive) down at the back of the engine near the firewall. Here's a picture showing what the sensors look like: Tools 10 mm socket or 5 mm Allen head socket (depending on type of sensor retaining bolt) 6 mm Allen head socket 0.8 mm thick washer Multi-Meter (for checking sensor resistances) Oscilloscope (optional - for checking sensor output) Checking Sensor Operation Sensor Resistance Checks Disconnect the Sensor plug connector at the back of the engine compartment. Using a multi-meter, check the sensor resistances as follows: Speed Sensor Terminals Resistance Reading 8 - 27 600 - 1600 ohms 8 - 23 &gt; 1 M-ohm Reference Sensor Terminals Resistance Reading 25 - 26 600 - 1600 ohms 25 - 78 &gt; 1 M-ohm Sensor Operational Checks An operational check of the speed and reference sensor output signals is the ultimate test to show whether the sensors are providing proper signals to the DME computer. However, to correctly perform the test, it requires an oscilloscope. We'll also discuss checking the output with a multimeter. Remove the fuel pump fuse. Disconnect the DME computer plug. To check the speed sensor output, connect an oscilloscope from terminals 8 - 27 on the DME plug. Crank the vehicle and check for a saw tooth wave output with a peak-to-peak voltage of &gt; 2.5V. To check the reference sensor output, connect an oscilloscope from terminals 25 -26 on the DME plug. Crank the vehicle and check for a periodic pulse with a peak-to-peak voltage of &gt; 2.0V. The frequency of the pulses depends on the starter cranking speed. If either voltage is less than the spec, check the sensor clearance using the section titled &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot;. NOTE The sensor output signals can also be checked using a multi-meter. However, checking with a multi-meter will only tell you if there is and output signal and will not correctly measure the magnitude of the output voltage. So, it will not tell you if the signal is of significant magnitude to be sensed by the DME computer. Another way to check the operation of the speed and reference sensors it to crank the vehicle and watch the response of the tachometer. If the tachometer jumps during cranking, the speed and reference sensors are probably good. If it does not jump, it indicates a problem with the speed and/or reference sensor or the DME computer. If it's the speed and/or reference sensors, it could be a bad sensor or the clearance gap is too large (see &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot;). Sensor Removal Disconnect the battery negative lead. Disconnect the speed and/or reference sensor connectors at the back of the intake manifold. Remove the sensor retaining bolt. Two different types of retaining bolts were used on the sensors. You'll need a 5 mm Allen head socket or 10 mm socket and ratchet to remove the sensor retaining bolts. Twist the sensor from side-to-side as you pull up on it. Sometimes they'll get stuck and twisting will help free them. Sensor Installation If both sensors are to be replaced, check the labels on the wiring harness near the connector bracket and at the sensor mounting bracket to ensure correct installation. On the wiring harness the label will read as follows: DG = Speed Sensor BG = Reference Sensor The mounting bracket is labelled as follows: D = Speed Sensor B = Reference Sensor It is sometimes difficult to read the marks on the mounting bracket. If you can not read the marks, the sensor closest to the firewall is the speed sensor. NOTE I ran across a situation once while installing and engine in a 944 where the wire labels were missing from the wire connectors going to the DME Plug connector and the connectors had been removed from their mounting bracket. So, it was impossible to tell which wiring harness connector went to which sensor. To identify the connectors, I had to take resistance readings using an ohmmeter from the DME Plug connector to the sensor connectors. If you run into the same situation, you can use the diagrams below and an ohmmeter to determine which connector goes to which sensor. If the sensor mounting bracket was moved or you are unsure if the sensors are correctly aligned perform the &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot; procedure below. Install the sensors and retaining bolts. Torque retaining bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb). Adjusting Sensor Clearance The speed and reference sensors do not normally need adjustment even after replacement.

This can be particularly useful if you are considering changing to a transaxle with a different set of gears or to a different ring a pinion. It can also be used to determine how different wheel and tire size combinations will affect your speedometer. If you are trying to verify the accuracy of your speedometer, you should be confident that your tachometer is indicating correctly. If you doubt the accuracy of your tachometer, obtain a strobotach / stroboscope and check it or have a speedometer shop check it for you. You will also need to determine your gear sizes, final drive ratio, tire size, and wheel diameter to plug into the program. If you have an owner's manual, the gear sizes and final drive ratio will be listed there. For the tire and wheel size, simply look on the side of tires on your drive wheels (i.e. for a rear wheel drive car, look at the rear tires). Here's and example of how it will be listed and what each part means: For a car with 225/50VR16 tires: Tread Width 225 mm Aspect Ratio 50 Wheel Diameter 16 in. Note: Aspect Ratio is used to determine the height of the sidewall in terms of percent of tread width. For the example given, the height of the sidewall is 50% of the tread width or 112.5 mm. Some Web Browsers may have trouble running the form programs below. If so, you may perform the calculations yourself using the equations on the formula page. Tire Circumference Calculator Enter Tread Width (mm): Enter Aspect Ratio: Enter Wheel Diameter (in.): INCHES To determine your speedometer error, simply calculate several &quot;theoretical&quot; speeds at different Engine RPMs in the same gear. Use RPMs that are easily readable on your tachometer. Then take your car for a drive and record your &quot;indicated&quot; speedometer readings in the same gear and at the same RPMs as you used in the calculation. By graphing one line for your &quot;calculated&quot; speed and another for your &quot;indicated&quot; speed, you can trend your speedometer error over the entire range of that particular gear.

Aspect Ratio is used to determine the height of the sidewall in terms of percentage of the tread width. In the example given the height of the sidewall is 50% of the tread width or 112.5 mm. In the formula above, we would use .50 for the aspect ratio. Multiplying by 2 in the formula accounts for the height of the sidewall at the top and bottom of the wheel and dividing by 25.4 converts the total wall height from millimeters to inches. By adding the wheel diameter (given in inches) to the wall height, we obtain total diameter. Using the formula for circumference of a circle, we obtain the circumference of the tire.

If the battery is determined to be good, check the operation of the starter as follows: CAUTION I personally don't recommend testing the starter while it is in the vehicle. Realize that the engine will turn during starter testing and you should not apply a jumper to the starter while you are under the vehicle. Raise the vehicle on jack stands. Make sure that the transmission is not engaged in any gear. Make up two heavy gauge jumper wires (minimum 12 gauge wire) approximately 3 feet in length. Connect one jumper to the small terminal on the starter solenoid (not the terminal with the wire going to the starter motor). Connect the other jumper to the large positive terminal on the starter. Make sure you don't let the other end of this jumper touch any of the metal on the car as it is connected directly to the positive terminal on the battery. Make sure you are not underneath the car. Make sure you aren't touching any metal on the car. Momentarily touch the ends of the two jumpers to check the operation of the starter. If the starter operates normally, the problems lies in the ignition switch or wiring from the ignition switch to the starter. If the starter still does not operate, the problem is in the starter and it should be removed and taken to a service center or auto parts store for testing. The most likely cause of the failure is the starter solenoid (bendix). This can be replaced without replacing the entire starter. However, from past experience the price of a new bendix isn't much less than the price of a complete new starter.

Any standard DIN head unit will fit. However, there are some minor issues which must be considered. When you remove the factory head unit, you will likely have to install a mounting frame for the new head unit. If you have purchased a new head unit the mounting frame will be included. However, if you are buying a used head unit, make sure the seller includes the mounting frame as well (if required). If you are installing sub-woofers, or plan to install subwoofers in the future, make sure the new head unit has &quot;sub-woofer out&quot; or &quot;rear speaker out&quot; connections. Normally, units with &quot;sub-woofer out&quot; connections will also have a sub-woofer volume adjust as well. However, you may want to ask that question when purchasing the unit. Sub-woofer volume adjust on the head unit is a very nice feature because it allows you adjust everything at the head unit when balancing the sound. If you don't have sub-woofer controls, you end up having to tweak the gain on the sub-woofer amp to balance the sound. This is definitely a plus if the sub amp must be placed in a location that is difficult to access. All 944s which employ windshield antennas also use an antenna amplifier. The antenna amplifier is powered from a lead which goes from the head unit to a wire that ties in with the antenna lead. The problem is that there are actually two leads which come from the head unit (both red with white stripes) which feed into the wiring harness and come back out of the harness to a single black lead. The single black lead ties in with the antenna lead. Consequently, when you install the new head unit, you'll need to run a power lead off the head unit to the black amplifier lead or to the two red wires with white stripes going to the black amplifier lead. Newer 944s (1985.5 and newer) with 4-speaker systems use a front-to-rear fader control for the speakers (mounted on the center console). So, there are left and right channel feeds going from the head unit to the fader. Coming out of the fader are leads for each of the 4 speakers. If your head unit has a two-channel output, you'll connect to the to leads going to the fader just like the factory unit. If you have a head unit with a four-channel output, I prefer to bypass the fader and connect to the speaker leads coming out of the fader. This allows you full use of the fader controls on the head unit. If you bypass the factory fader switch, you may abandon it in place or you may remove the fader and obtain a blank switch cover to go in it's place. Speakers Our discussion here will focus on 944s with 4-speaker systems. I haven't talked to a lot of folks who have done replacements on the 10-speaker system so, there just isn't a lot of information available at this point. There are two distinct challenges when replacing the speakers in a 4-speaker 944 system - fitment of the front speakers and access to the rear speakers. For the front speakers, there are a number of issues with regards to finding a speaker that fits. Both front and rear speakers are 4x6 Euro cut speakers. A 4x6 American cut speaker can be used as well. However, for the front speakers, the mounting plate for the American cut speaker must be trimmed or the bottom of the door panel must be loosened to allow the edges of the mounting plate to slide under the panel. Personally, I have the 4x6 American cut speakers and didn't find it too inconvenient to loosen the bottom of the door panel for the installation. Also, you must use a speaker with a thin mounting plate. A speaker with a thick mounting plate will prevent the factory grill from sitting flush with the door panel. The next fitment issue for the front speakers is depth. The door window channel runs directly behind the door speaker. The factory speakers use a 1/4&quot; spacer. If you reuse the speakers, you can get about 1-3/4&quot; clearance. Even that limits your choices with regards to speakers. If you go with a deeper speaker, you will have to use a thicker spacer is which case the factory speaker grills will not sit flush anymore. Aftermarket grills are available but, they are hard to come by. American International (AI) is one of the few places I've found that offers 4x6 grills. If you have a decent car audio shop in your area, they should be able to locate aftermarket grills for you. Also, you can't use a grill that protrudes from the surface of the door panel more than 1/2&quot; or it will contact the side of the dash with the door closed. If you want to use the factory grills (as I did), you also have to make sure that the replacement speakers do not have any parts/components that are raised above the surface of the speaker more than about 1/4&quot;. Otherwise, the grills will not sit flush with the door panel. The last issue with front speaker fitment is the size of the speaker frame. For virtually all the aftermarket speakers I tried (and I trial fitted a lot of speakers), the oval part of the speaker frame was slightly larger than the oval cutout in the door panel. This will prevent the speaker from sitting flush against the door panel. Consequently, the factory grill will not sit flush either. I eventually had to go with the speaker that was the best fit and enlarge the opening in the door panel slightly to allow a perfect fit. I did this by taking a small hammer and tapping on the sides of the opening to flatten the lip on the opening slightly. When you are trying to decide on a front speaker, I recommend removing one of the door speakers and then drive to a local stereo/sound and ask them to allow you to trial fit different 4x6 speakers until you find one that fits properly. I have read reports from other 944 owners of speakers which fit well without any modifications. Below is a list of 4x6 speakers used by other 944 owners, with comments on fitment and sound quality. The list was provided to Rennlist by Menelaos Karamichalis. Thanks Menelaos. 944 Speakers (4x6) Speaker Application Comments Eclipse Front Requires slight modification of door opening for proper fit.

However, it's just takes a little time and patience. Many folks will tell you that the rear quarter glass MUST be removed. However, that's not true. I've done it removing the rear glass and without removing the rear glass. I really have no preference. I will describe both methods here and let you decide which you feel most comfortable with. Tools Medium Phillips Head Screwdriver Metric Socket Set Flat tip screwdriver or small pry bar Speaker Removal Open the door and remove the plastic kick plate strip at the bottom of the door opening. It is held in place by clips and can be removed by sliding your fingers under the clip and pulling up. Do so gently so you don't damage the strip. Pull the rubber trim off of the back of the door jamb from the bottom of the door to about 3/4 of the way up the door opening. Remove the Phillips Head screw that is located near the bottom of the door opening in the interior trim panel. Remove the Phillips Head screw at the base of the trim panel below speaker opening. NOTE Later 944s are equipped with a shoulder harness for the rear seats. If your car is not equipped with rear shoulder harnesses, skip the following step and go to Step 6. Open the rear hatch and remove the plastic cover from the rear seat belt shoulder harness mount. Since my car is not equipped with rear shoulder harnesses, the following picture shows the mounting of the front shoulder harness as it is identical. Once you have the plastic cover off, remove the hex head bolt that holds the shoulder harness mount in place. If your car is NOT equipped with rear shoulder harnesses, it will have a large Phillips Head screw in place of the shoulder harness mount. Remove this screw (1). Also, remove the small Phillips Head screw below and toward the rear of the car (2) from the shoulder harness mounting point. Remove the rubber cover from the rear seat latch pin. When you remove the cover, you'll see a hex shaped portion of the pin. Use an open end wrench to remove the latch pin. Remove the two Phillips Head screws at the top of the trim panel. Use one of the following two options to loosen the interior panel covering from the window opening: Option 1 Using a flat tip screwdriver work you way around the perimeter of the rear window (inside the car) lifting up the rubber trim so you can pull the trim panel upholstery away from the lip around the glass. Pull on the upholstery gently so you don't tear it. Option 2 Remove the rear quarter glass by lifting up on the rubber trim around the window (inside the car) while gently pushing out on the window. Start at the lower back corner of the window. Be careful when you push on the window as it is possible to break the window. The speaker panel should now be free to be pulled away from the body. Realize that the seat belt is still inserted through the opening in the panel. So, as you pull the panel out, you'll have to work around it. Remove the screws that hold the speakers into the body behind the trim panel. The speaker may be mounted on plastic bushings. Be sure not to drop the bushings as you remove the screws. On later cars, the factory 4x6 speakers are mounted in a bracket that can be removed to allow the installation of a larger speaker. Once the screws are removed, disconnect the wires from the back of the speaker and remove the speaker from the car. Installation Attach the speaker wires to the back of the speaker. Mount the speaker in the panel using the four mounting screws. If the speaker you removed was mounting with plastic bushings, make sure you install the bushings when you install the speaker. Test the speaker before proceeding. Push the speaker trim panel into place. Install the panel trim around the window as follows: Rear Window Not Removed Lift the rubber trim around the rear window as you push the trim panel upholstery under the rubber trim. Rear Window Removed Install the rear window glass by wrapping a piece of heavy string around three sides of the window inside the groove of the rubber trim piece (top, front, and bottom side but not the back side). Insert the back edge of the glass into the window opening with the groove of the rubber trim piece on the lip of the window opening (ends of the string on the inside of the car). While holding the glass against the outside of the car, start pulling one end of the string from inside the car. This will pull the rubber trim piece over the lip of the window opening. Install the five small Phillips Head screws for the trim panel Install the rear seat latch pin. Install the rear seat belt mount (if equipped) or large Phillips Head screw insert.

Keep the heat gun moving back and forth and do not apply excessive heat as it will soften and potentially damage the paint. Once you get one edge lifted, grasp the edge of the stone guard and pull gently as you apply heat just ahead of the edge that's lifted. Again, keep the heat gun moving, do not heat excessively, and do not apply too much pressure or you will lift the paint along with the stone guard. If you get to a spot that's stubborn and does not want to lift, apply some of the adhesive remover behind the lifted edge. Continue to apply heat but, do so carefully as most adhesive removers are flammable. Once the stone guard is completely removed, clean the area with adhesive solvent to remove any remaining adhesive. Installation NOTE New stone guard material should only be applied to paint that is completely dry and properly cured. Mix a solution of isopropryl alcohol and water (about 15% alcohol) Thoroughly clean the area where the stone guard will be applied. Apply the alcohol solution to the area.

Loosen the four strut mounting bolts in the engine compartment several turns. Do not remove yet. Place the vehicle on jack stands. Remove the front wheels. Remove the brake line from the clip on the front strut. At the bottom of the strut, there are two bolts which attach the front strut to the spindle assembly. The top bolt is an eccentric bolt which provides for adjustment of the wheel camber. Using a paint pen, scribe, or brightly colored nail polish, mark the orientation of the eccentric bolt to the strut. Remove the eccentric bolt and bottom retaining bolt from the bottom of the strut. Pull the strut away from the spindle until it is free from the bottom of the assembly. Hold the strut while removing the four mounting bolts at the top of the strut. Remove strut from the vehicle. If the strut is to be replaced, note the orientation of the eccentric bolt alignment mark from Step six and transfer that mark to the new strut. Strut Insert Replacement CAUTION! Extreme caution must be used when using double spring compressors where the springs are not held rigidly in place. This is the type of compressors you'll normally find for sale in auto parts stores or those offered by auto parts stores for loan. I've seen a number of folks get badly hurt when the spring popped out of one of the compressors. The key to using this style or spring compressor safely is to make small adjusts and alternate sides after each adjustment. The safest type of compressor is a rigid wall or stand mounted professional spring compressor. However, most of us aren't willing to go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a professional spring compressor. So, you have two options. You can use the double spring compressors as described above or you can simply take the strut assembly and the new insert to a suspension and brake shop and have them swap the insert for you. Using a spring compressor tool, compress the coil over spring to until there is only a slight amount of pressure on the strut assembly top plate. NOTE If you attempt to use a regular socket and ratchet to remove the strut assembly top plate retaining nut, the strut rod will simply spin as you turn the retaining nut. An air impact wrench is needed to spin the nut fast enough to break the nut free without spinning the strut rod. Using an air impact wrench and socket, remove the spring strut bearing retaining nut. Remove the bearing from the strut. Slide the strut assembly out of the spring If you're rebuilding the old strut perform the following: Clamp the assembly in a vise and remove the strut assembly insert cap using Porsche tool 9186 or a similar tool. Remove the old insert from the strut. Remove any oil from the housing and clean the inside of the housing. Install the new cartridge. Ensure that the spacer is installed between the cap and the cartridge. Torque cartridge cap to 150 &plusmn; 30 Nm (111 &plusmn; 22 ft-lbs.). Note From Factory Shop Manual The shock absorber housing may be filled with thin oil or ATF to improve cooling. However, the shock absorber housing should not be more than max. 2/3 full, if cartridge is touching bottom of housing. If too much oil was added, it would run out of the housing when hot. This would automatically cause incorrect diagnosis (defective absorber). Install the spring onto the new or rebuild strut assembly. Install the bearing onto the spring strut assembly. Using an air impact wrench and socket, tighten the spring strut bearing retaining nut. Torque the retaining nut to 77 Nm (57 ft-lbs.). The strut assembly is now ready to be installed in the car. Installation Insert the new or rebuilt strut assembly up through the opening at the top of the strut tower and loosely install the four retaining nuts on top of the strut tower. Slide the bottom of the strut onto the spindle and install the bottom retaining nut and top eccentric nut. Set the top eccentric nut to the orientation mark on the strut made during the strut removal. Tighten the eccentric bolt locking nut and the bottom retaining bolt lock nut. NOTE Even though the strut was aligned using the mark for the eccentric bolt, the car should be taken to an alignment shop to have the camber checked at the first opportunity.

On cars made after February 1986, the lifting arms are operated by plastic gears (one for each lifting arm mechanism). The plastic gears have a small set of teeth which operate the lifting arms. They also have a large set of teeth which are driven by a flexible cable. The cable is driven by the sunroof motor.      For cars produced before February 1986, there is a gear box between the two lifting arm mechanisms. This gear box has a single gear which moves the lifting arms via two short lengths of drive cable. The guide tubes for the short sections of the flexible drive cable are routed such that the drive cables are directly engaged in the teeth on the lifting arms as opposed to using a plastic drive gear in each lifting arm housing.      The sunroof drive motor assembly is located in the rear hatch area behind the vertical section of carpet on the driver's side of the car. On most cars the motor assembly will have a plastic cover over it which is held in place by six Phillips head screws.      The sunroof system on all 944s uses a series of micro-switches to stop the lifting arms in different positions. The functioning of the sunroof depends on the ignition switch position and the direction that the console switch is operated. The ignition switch on 1985.5 and newer cars is a three-position switch whereas the early ignition switch is a two-position switch (OFF-ON). On the later cars, it's a OFF (0) - ACCESSORY (1) - ON (2) switch. You'll frequently hear the ignition switch &quot;ON&quot; position referred to as ignition switch position 2. To operate the sunroof in the open or closed direction, the ignition switch is turned to the &quot;ON&quot; position. To release the sunroof the ignition switch must be in the &quot;OFF&quot; position for the early 944s or in the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position for the late model 944s. Specifics on how to operate and remove the sunroof are discussed in another section of this procedure.      All sunroofs installed since February 1986 have three limit switches which are operated by a plastic cam attached to the sunroof drive cable. The cam assembly rotates as the drive motor moves the drive cable and as the cam rotates it operates the limit switches.      In cam position 1, the lifting arms are fully retracted back against the body of the sunroof so that the sunroof can be removed from the car. This is referred to as the &quot;released&quot; position. In this particular instance, both Limit Switches I and II are made. Limit Switches I and II are ganged together and can only be adjusted together. Limit Switch I is the bottom switch and Limit Switch II is the top switch. They function to stop the lifting arms in the &quot;locked&quot; position. If the lifting arms are in the released position and both limit switches are not made or are not functioning properly, the lifting arms can not be moved to the &quot;locked&quot; position.      In cam position 2, the lifting arms are partially raised so that the sunroof is still closed but, it is locked in the closed position. As the lifting arms are moved toward the locked position, the cam rotates. When the cam reaches position 2, Limit Switch II drops out to stop the sunroof motor. As previously mentioned, the ignition switch must be in the ACCESSORY position to operate the sunroof between the retracted and locked positions (from cam position 1 to 2). When moving the lifting arm from the locked position to the released position, movement of the lifting arms is stopped by the slip clutch on the sunroof motor when the lifting arm tabs contact the body of the sunroof opening. This is a very common problem area. Over time, the motor slip clutch torque tends to increase. There really isn't a good explanation for why this occurs but, it does. Eventually, the torque will get high enough so that when the lifting arms are retracted and come in contact with the body, the sunroof motor have enough torque to cause the drive cable to strip the teeth on the plastic sunroof gears. The procedure for adjusting the slip clutch torque will be discussed later.      To raise the sunroof from the locked position, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed (Up Arrow), the sunroof will start to raise and the cam rotates. As soon as the cam starts to rotate, Limit Switch I drops out. The sunroof will continue to raise as long as the console switch is depressed until the roof reaches the fully open position (cam position 3). When the cam hits limit switch III, the sunroof stops in the fully open position.      To lower the sunroof from the fully raised position, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed (Down Arrow), the sunroof lowers until cam position 2 is reached. When the cam makes Limit Switch I, the sunroof stops in the locked postion.      The operation of sunroofs on 944s produced from 1982 to February 1986 is essentially identical to that of later 944 sunroof systems. The primary differences are in the physical construction of the sunroof equipment.      One of the major differences is the set up of the drive motor and limit switches. The early sunroof assembly does not use a rotating cam to operate the limit switches. Instead, there is a guide rail attached to the sunroof motor which extends toward the rear of the car. At the very back of the guide rail is two limit switches. These are equivalent to Limit Switches I and II on the late model sunroof systems. They function together to stop the lifting arms in the locked position and are operated by a plastic dog that is attached to the end of the drive cable.      Like the late model sunroof, in the locked position, one limit switch is made and one is not. To open the sunroof, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed the sunroof moves in the open direction and is stopped when the mirco-switch mounted between the sunvisors drops out. The micro-switch is operated by a tab attached to the front edge of the sunroof hatch. As the back of the sunroof hatch raises during opening, the tab on the front of the hatch swings down. When it swings down far enough, the mirco-switch drops out (electrically opens) and the sunroof motor stops. This micro-switch is also used on the late model sunroofs but, merely functions as a backup to Limit Switch III.      From the locked position, to move the lifting arms to the released position (for sunroof removal), the ignition switch must be in the OFF position. As the lifting arms move to the released position, movement of the lifting arms is stopped by the motor's slip clutch when the lifting arm tabs contact the body of the sunroof opening. And, when moving the lifting arms from the released position to the locked position, the sunroof motor is stopped when one of the limit switches drops out. The mircro-switch between the sunvisors also performs an additional function on both early and late model sunroofs. It tells the system that the sunroof is installed. If the sunroof is installed but, the lifting arms are released, the system will automatically move the lifting arms to the locked position when the car starts moving. If the sunroof fails electrically, it can be operated manually. However, operating an early sunroof manually is difficult at best and should only be done if absolutely necessary. Directions for sunroof manual operation are contained in another section of this procedure. To troubleshoot problems with the sunroof system, refer to the troubleshooting section of this procedrue. Normal Operation On pre-1985.5 cars, the sunroof is operated by turning the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position. The sunroof console switch is then pushed back (&quot;A&quot; direction) to open the sunroof and pushed forward (&quot;B&quot; direction) to close. NOTE The ignition switch on 1985.5 and newer cars is a three-position switch whereas the early ignition switch is a two-position switch (OFF-ON). On the later cars, it's a OFF (0) - Accessory (1) - ON (2) switch. You'll frequently hear the ignition switch &quot;ON&quot; position referred to as ignition switch position 2. To operate the late model sunroof, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position. The sunroof console switch is then pushed back (up arrow) to open the sunroof and pushed forward (down arrow) to close. Removing the Sunroof Retract the sunroof lifting arms as follows: On pre-1985.5 cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Depress the sunroof switch in the back direction (&quot;A&quot; in picture from previous section) to retract the sunroof lifting arms. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position (1). Depress the sunroof switch in the back direction (Up Arrow on Switch) to retract the sunroof lifting arms. Release the two latches at the front of the sunroof. From inside the car, push up on the back of the sunroof and slide it off of the wind deflector and front guides. Installing the Sunroof Slide the sunroof hatch on to the wind deflector guides until it seats at the front of the sunroof opening. Lower the back of the sunroof in to the sunroof opening. It should sit flush with the top of the roof. Engage the latches at the front of the sunroof. NOTE When raising the sunroof lifting arms from the retracted position (for removal), the lifting arms should automatically stop at the locked closed position. Engage the sunroof lifting arms as follows: On pre-1985.5 cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Depress the sunroof switch in the forward direction (&quot;B&quot; in picture from previous section) to raise the sunroof lifting arms. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position (1). Depress the sunroof switch in the foward direction (Down Arrow on Switch) to raise the sunroof lifting arms. Sunroof Manual Operation Operate the early 944 (1982 - February 1986) sunroof manually as follows: Unclip the carpet on the driver's side (left-hand drive) of the hatch area. There you will find the sunroof motor and cable drive assembly. Below and to the left of the sunroof motor you should find a manual operating tool attached to the cable guide by two wing nuts. Unscrew the wing nuts and remove the tool. Below and to the right of the sunroof motor there is an adjusting screw for the motor slip clutch. There should be a cap over the adjusting screw. Remove the cap and, using the tool, remove the adjusting screw (a). Once the adjusting screw is removed, you'll find a threaded sleeve inside the opening for the screw. Insert the tapered end of the tool into the sleeve and turn the sleeve to operate the sunroof. Turning the sleeve counter-clockwise will close the sunroof and turning it clockwise will open the sunroof. When manual operation is complete, install the adjusting screw into the threaded sleeve. Adjust the slip clutch torque using the slip clutch adjustment procedure. Operate the late 944 (February 1986 - On) sunroof manually as follows: Unclip the carpet on the driver's side (left-hand drive) of the hatch area. There you will find the sunroof motor and cable drive assembly. The assembly may have a plastic cover. Although on many of the late model cars, I've found that the cover has been removed. Remove the slip clutch adjusting screw cap. You'll find the cap, below and to the right of the sunroof motor. If the sunroof motor assemby has the plastic cover discussed in the previous step, the adjusting screw cover will be visible in an opening in the motor assembly cover. Behind the adjusting screw cap, you'll find a small lock nut which locks the slip clutch adjusting screw in position. Behind that, there is a larger nut which is used to manually operate the sunroof. Use a spark plug socket (13/16&quot;) or a 21 mm socket on the large nut to operate the sunroof. Turn the nut clockwise to close the sunroof and counter-clockwise to open. NOTE Since the position of the slip clutch adjustment screw has not been altered, it is not necessary to perform a slip clutch adjustment. Sunroof Motor Slip Clutch Adjustment There are two different procedures for adjusting the slip clutch on a 944 sunroof motor based on whether you have an early style sunroof (before February 1986) or a late style sunroof. The early style sunroof slip clutch is set from the factory and should only be adjusted if the slip clutch adjusting screw has been removed for manual operation of the sunroof. On the style sunroof, the slip clutch adjusting screw is permanently attached and is not removed for manual operation of the sunroof. However, the slip clutch torque should be periodically checked and adjusted if needed. High slip clutch torque is the most common cause of the failure (stripping) of the plastic sunroof gears in the late style sunroofs. If you are unsure whether you have an early or late style sunroof, refer to the pictures below. Note that the motor case on the early style sunroof system is black and the motor is oriented parallel to the ground. The late style sunroof motor case is gold in color, is oriented at an angle to the ground, and has it's electrical connector on top of the motor. Early Sunroof Motor and Slip Clutch Adjusting Screw Location Late Sunroof Motor and Limit Switches Early Style Slip Clutch Checking and Adjustment The early style sunroof motor slip clutch has an adjusting screw that has a locknut that is cemented to the adjusting screw at a preset distance from the head of the adjusting screw (2.5 mm) to ensure proper slip clutch torque. However, if the adjusting screw is removed for manual sunroof operation, the slip clutch torque must be verified by checking the sunroof motor current after the adjusting screw is reinstalled.  &nbsp Remove fuse 9 from the Auxiliary Fuse Panel and connect an ammeter across the fuse block terminals. Thread the adjusting screw into the slip clutch until the lock nut comes in contact with the mounting surface and tighten it slightly. Turn the ignition switch on (or insert the key into the ignition) and operate the sunroof switch until the sunroof reaches it's final drive position (full open or fully retracted). I prefer to operate the motor to the full open position as the motor current tends to be higher (due to the weight of the sunroof). Check the motor current when the drive motor reaches it's final drive position. On the early sunroofs the limit switch between the sunvisors mays stop the motor before it reaches the full open position. If so, you may press the micro-switch manually to operate the motor long enough to check the motor current. Tighten the adjusting screw until the motor current is 12 -14 Amps. This may require loosening the adjusting screw lock nut. When the adjusting screw it properly set, tighten the lock nut against the mounting surface and apply heavy strength Loctite to the adjusting screw threads at the lock nut. Disconnect the ammeter and reinstall the sunroof motor fuse (25 A). Late Style Sunroof Slip Clutch Checking and Adjustment Open the sunroof about 1/2 open. This will prevent damaging the plastic gears during slip clutch testing. Using a 21 mm socket and torque wrench, turn hexagonal nut A on the motor slip clutch (see picture below). The clutch should slip at 6 Nm (&plusmn; 0.5 Nm). I normally like to see the torque at the low end of the spec or even slightly below (5 - 5.5 Nm) to ensure that the plastic gears don't get stripped again. The breaking loose torque of the motor can vary at different gear position. So, the torque should be checked six times at 60 degree angles of rotation on the hexagonal nut A (i.e. 360 degrees total or six times during one full rotation of the nut). A - Checking Torque B - Adjusting Torque C - Lock Nut            If the slip clutch needs adjustment perform the following Loosen lock nut C. Adjust the motor torque by moving adjusting nut B. Loosening nut B will lower the torque. Tightening nut B will raise the torque. When the torque is properly adjusted, apply a small amount of Loctite 270 to the adjusting screw threads and tighten lock nut C to a torque of 15 &plusmn; 2 Nm.

This micro-switch serves to stop the sunroof in the fully raised position on early 944 sunroof systems (1982 - February 1986). The mirco-switch is also present on later sunroof systems and functions as a backup to Limit Switch III. This micro-switch is one of the more common failure items on the sunroof. It will prevent the sunroof from operating electrically in the open direction. This means that it can prevent the sunroof from moving from the locked position to the open position OR from the released position to the locked position. However, it should NOT prevent the roof from operating in the closed direction. Removing and Replacing the Micro-Switch Release and remove the sunroof hatch. If the sunroof system can not be operated electrically, then manually release the lifting arms using the manual operating instructions in the &quot;Sunroof Operation, Troubleshooting, and Repair&quot; procedure. Carefully remove the triangular shaped flap from the sunroof mount. Use a small flat tip screwdriver or plastic spatula to pry up gently on either side of the flap. The is snapped into clips on the sunroof mount. The clips on the mount or the tabs on the flap can be easily broken if you pry too hard on the flap. Once the flap is removed, use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the retaining screw from the mount and press the mount off of the wind deflector bar. If the micro-switch is to be replaced, unsolder the wires from switch and install a new switch. Checking the Sunroof Micro-Switch for Proper Operation      For the sunroof to operate in the open direction, the micro-switch between the sun visors must be closed and must remain closed. If the micro-switch is open, fails electrically (open), or has a broken wire in the circuit, the sunroof will not open. Check the operation of the micro-switch as follows: Remove the sunroof hatch. Press on the flap covering the sunroof mount (covering the micro-switch). An audible click should be heard when the flap is depressed. If the click is not heard, remove the flap carefully as described in the previous section. Depress the micro-switch operating lever and again listen for an audible click. If an audible click can not be heard or if you still have doubts about whether the microswitch is functioning properly, check the switch electrically. To check the micro-switch electrically, perform the following: Lower the sunroof mount (containing the micro-switch) from the roof panel using the directions for removal/replacement in the previous section. Connect an ohmmeter across the two terminal of the micro-switch. It should read infinite ohms (&infin; or OL or Off Scale High depending on what type of meter you use) Depress the operating lever for the micro-switch. It should read minimum resistance (&lt; 1 ohm). If the switch does not pass the electrical test, replace it. NOTE The sunroof micro-switch is operated by a tab on the front of the sunroof hatch. Sometimes that tab can become bent and will not be high enough to depress the micro-switch operator enough to close the switch. If the micro-switch appears to be functioning normally, check it again with the roof installed and closed. If you press upward on the tab at the front of the sunroof and you hear and audible click from the micro-switch, the tab is not bent enough to keep the micro-switch closed. Remove the roof and bent the tab upward slightly until it will close the micro-switch with the roof installed and closed. Main Sunroof Relay Testing On early 944s with the small console switch (see picture below), remove the switch from the top of the console using a small flat tip screwdriver or plastic spatula. On late model 944s with the larger switch, disconnect the sunroof switch plug as follows: Remove the storage pocket underneath the radio. This can be done by sliding both hands into the pocket, and pressing outward on the sides of the pocket with your hands while pulling the pocket straight out of the console. This will expose two Phillips head screws which you'll need to remove.   Remove the ash tray from the center console by pulling it straight up out of the console and remove the two Phillips head screws at the back of the console. Lift up on the console insert. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switch which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you more angry than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily.   NOTE On early cars the main sunroof relay checks can be performed on in the back of the switch with it connected to the harness. On the later cars, the checks are performed on the disconnected plug for the sunroof switch.   Check the main sunroof relay output voltages as follows: On early 944 sunroofs, insert the key into the ignition but, do not turn the switch on. On late 944 sunroofs, turn the ignition to the ACCESSORY position. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 2 of the sunroof switch / plug. On early and late 944s, turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 1 of the sunroof switch / plug. Also, check that the voltage at terminal 2 of the switch / plug is no longer present. If the correct output voltages are not present, remove the sunroof main relay. On early 944 (pre-1985.5), the sunroof relay is on the main relay and fuse panel. It is the second relay from the left on the top row of relays. On late model 944s, the sunroof main relay is G18 on the central electric panel. Check for proper supply voltage to the main relay as follows: On early 944 sunroofs, insert the key into the ignition but, do not turn the switch on. On late 944 sunroofs, turn the ignition to the ACCESSORY position. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal R of the sunroof relay socket. On early and late 944s, turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal A and terminal R of the sunroof relay socket. If the correct supply voltages are present and the correct output voltages are not present, the main sunroof relay is most likely faulty and needs to be replaced. If the correct output voltages are present, the main sunroof relay is functioning sufficiently to raise and lower the sunroof and to release the lifting arms for sunroof removal. NOTE There is one remaining check on the main sunroof relay performance. This has to do with the function of the lifting arms to raise from the retracted position to the locked position if the sunroof is installed and the car's speed is sensed to be greater than 5 km/h (3 mph). This can be performed by checking for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 5 of the console switch plug with the car rolling at greater than the required speed. On early 944s (pre-1985.5) this can be done by raising the front of the car and spinning the left front wheel. The 5 km/h is sensed by a hall sensor on the left front wheel. On late 944s, the speed signal comes from the electronic speedometer signal from the hall sensor mounted in the transaxle. So, the car has to be driven or the rear of the car has to be raised and the transaxle rotated to check the voltage. Limit Switch Testing Introduction The sunroof limit switches are a common source of problems with sunroof operation. However, there are fewer problems associated with the limit switches than are often attributed to them. On early 944 sunroofs, the limit switches are located at the back of the sunroof drive cable guide rail. The rail extends from the sunroof motor toward the rear of the car. The limit switches are located on the back side of the rail. The top limit switch is Limit Switch 1 and the bottom is Limit Switch 2. On the late model sunroof system the limit switches are located almost directly above the sunroof motor. The bottom limit switch is Limit Switch I and the top is Limit Switch II. Below are diagrams showing the early and late model sunroof limit switches and wiring connections and a table showing the limit switch positions and terminal readings for the various sunroof positions.

This can be done by sliding both hands into the pocket, and pressing outward on the sides of the pocket with your hands while pulling the pocket straight out of the console. This will expose two Phillips head screws which you'll need to remove.   Remove the ash tray from the center console by pulling it straight up out of the console and remove the two Phillips head screws at the back of the console. Lift up on the console insert. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switch which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you more angry than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily.   The console switch can be tested while it is still in the console insert. However, if you desire to remove and test it or if the switch has been tested and determined to be faulty, remove it as follows: There is a tab on either side of the console switch that holds it into the console insert. Use extreme caution when removing any console switch as the retaining tabs are easily broken. Insert a small flat tip screwdriver into the opening on the console insert to depress the tab on the switch while gently pulling outward on the switch. Often the switch will come out by just releasing the tab on one side of the switch and swinging it out of the holder. However, if you feel any resistance, depress the tab on the other side of the switch to release it and slide it out of the holder. When re-installing the switch or installing a new switch, slide it straight into the holder on the back of the console insert. Console Switch Testing The pictures shown for this section are for an early 944 sunroof system console switch. However, the function and switch terminal labelling is identical for the late model sunroof system console switch.   When the sunroof switch is depressed in the BACK (A) direction, the resistance readings between terminals 2-5 and terminals 1-3 on the console switch should be less than 1 ohm. When the switch is depressed it the FORWARD (B) direction, the resistance readings between terminals 2-6 and terminals 2-4 should be less than 1 ohm. If the proper readings are obtained, the sunroof switch is good. Directional Relay Testing If one or both of the sunroof directional relays is bad, the sunroof will typically not operate in any direction. However, it is possible for the sunroof to operate in one direction and not the other with one bad directional relay. Therefore, when testing the directional relays, it's a good idea to test both relays at the same time. Testing Remove both sunroof directional relays from the terminal block near the sunroof motor (see picture above). The relays can be difficult to remove and it may be necessary to pry gently with a small flat tip screwdriver along the bottom edge of the relay to free it from the terminal block. If so, use extreme caution when trying to pry up the relay as the terminal (87) closest to the outside of the car (later sunroof systems) on each relay will always have 12 VDC present. NOTE The directional relay terminals should be clearly labelled on the bottom of the relay. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 30 and 87a on the relay. The resistance read across those terminals should be less than 1 ohm. Connect a DC voltage source to the relay (a 9V battery is normally sufficient) with the DC positive lead connected to terminal 85 of the relay and the DC negative lead connected to terminal 86. You should hear an audible click from the relay. The resistance now read across terminals 30 and 87a of the relay should be &infin;. Move the ohmmeter lead from terminal 87a to terminal 87 of the relay. The resistance should read less than 1 ohm. Disconnect the DC voltage source from the relay. You should again hear an audible click. The resistance between terminals 30 and 87 should now read &infin;. If all of the resistance checks on the relay are good, the relay is functioning normally. While checking the directional relays, it's also a good idea to check that the voltage supply to the relay terminal block is good and that the wiring connections from the relay block to ground are good. These insure checks ensure that the relay will function properly provided it gets a signal from the sunroof switch to actuate. On early 944 sunroof systems, install the ignition key into the ignition (not required on later sunroof cars). With a multimeter, you should read 12 VDC on both terminal 87s to ground and less than 1 ohm resistance between the 86 terminals to ground and 87a terminals to ground. If the voltage reading on the 87 terminals is bad, check the following: On later sunroof cars, check fuse #1 on the central electrical panel. On early sunroof cars, check fuse #9 on the additional fuse panel. If fuse #9 is good, check fuse #6 on the main fuse panel. Sunroof Motor Testing Testing the sunroof motor is only necessary if the sunroof motor will not run and all of the other associated tests are satisfactory. To test the sunroof motor simply disconnect the sunroof motor plug connector and connect an external 12 VDC voltage supply. Ignition Switch Testing If the main sunroof relay does not test satisfactorily, it may be due to a faulty power supply to the the relay. This is most likely due to a faulty ignition switch or wiring between the ignition switch and relay. Ignition Switch - Early Sunroof Cars Insert the key into the ignition switch. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; on the main sunroof relay socket. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position and check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 15 on the sunroof relay socket. Ignition Switch - Late Sunroof Cars Turn the ignition switch to the ACCESSORY position. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; on the main sunroof relay socket. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position and check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 15 on the sunroof relay socket. Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[165]=new Array("shop-manual/body-04.htm","Sunroof Gear Replacement","","BODY-04, Sunroof - Plastic Gear Replacement Acrobat Printable Version Parts Part Part Number Plastic Sunroof Gear (Feb. 1986 - 1991) 944-564-430-01 Procedure The first step in replacing the plastic gears in the late model 944 sunroof is to determine whether one or both of the gears are stripped. If only one of the gears is stripped, it simplifies the replacement process. The gear which has not been stripped can be use as a reference for setting the other lifting arm. First remove the sunroof from the car. If necessary operate the sunroof manually to retract the lifting arms for removal. If you haven't located the motor assembly yet, it is behind the vertical section of carpet in the rear hatch area (behind the hatch compartment light). The carpet is held in place by plastic push plugs. You should be able to slide your fingers behind the carpet and gently pull out to get the plugs out. Your sunroof motor assembly may or may not have a black plastic cover over it. The cover has four Phillips head screws that hold it in place. There is a black plastic cone shaped dust cover on the drive assembly at the base of the motor. Behind the cover, there are three nuts. The outer two nuts are for adjusting the torque for the motor's slip clutch. The large one in back (21mm) can be turned to move the cable/cam. It is also used to check the torque of the sunroof motor's slip clutch and also how you raise and lower the sunroof if the motor fails. If the nut is rotated in the clockwise direction, it will retract the lifting arms so that the sunroof can be removed. Rotate just enough to get the sunroof out. If one of the gears is still good and the torque on the slip clutch is too high, retracting the lifting arm against the back of the roof may strip the remaining gear. The next step is to disassemble the headliner to get to the lifting arms. There is a cover on the back part of the headliner which is held in place by Phillips head screws. The screws should have plastic covers over them which will have to be pried off to get to the screws. It's easiest to do this with the back seat down and the rear hatch raised while lying on your back in the luggage compartment. Pull back the weather-stripping along the top edge of the hatch. This will expose the back edge of the headliner which is wrapped around the edge of the body. Gently pull the headliner loose from the body all the way across the edge of the hatch. This will expose the lifting arm mechanisms. If you have the new style lifting assembly, there will be the two lifting arm boxes with a single drive cable guide tube along the bottom of both mechanisms. If there is a box between the two mechanisms with several different guide tubes, you have the old style mechanism. This procedure does not cover the old style mechanism. Carefully remove the lifting arm covers (one at a time) and inspect the gears. Try to keep the gear and the lifting arm from falling out when you remove the cover. If the gear is still good you will be able to use it as a reference for setting the other lifting arm. If one of the gears is good replace the cover. Remove the lifting arm and plastic gear for the ones that are bad. There is a metal washer on the back of the plastic gear which you will need to retain for reinstallation. The grease in the mechanism may cause it to stick in the mechanism housing instead of coming out with the gear. Next, set the sunroof motor assembly so that micro-switch I is made and micro-switch II is not. Here's how you do it. Once the sunroof motor cover is removed you can see the sunroof motor and two of the three limit switches. On the back side of the motor assembly is a white plastic cam that is attached to the end of the cable that operates the lifting arms. As the motor drives the cable, the cam rotates and hits the different micro-switches to stop the lifting arms. The sunroof motor is mounted on its side and has a round drive assembly at one end. With the ignition switch in position 2 and the sunroof installed, depress the up arrow on the console switch until the motor stops. Then depress the down arrow on the console switch until the motor stop. At the motor assembly, there are two micro-switches above the motor. There is a small opening behind the micro-switches that you can see through. If the cam is set properly, you should be able to see the white plastic cam hitting the arm on the bottom micro-switch (should be labeled I). The cam should not yet have hit the arm on the other micro-switch (labeled II). If you are unsure if it is properly set, you can adjust it manually and listen for the micro-switch to click. If you turn the nut counterclockwise the cam will rotate toward the left away from the micro-switch arms. This is just like raising the sunroof. Turn it counter clockwise enough so that you're sure the cam is not hitting the micro-switch. Then turn it back clockwise until it hits the bottom micro-switch arm. You should hear it click. While you're at it, you may want to rotate the cam far enough clockwise to hear micro-switch II click. This isn't a guarantee that both micro-switches are working electrically, but it does verify that they are working mechanically. Once you've done this, set the cam back to where that just micro-switch I (bottom) is made. This is the correct position for the sunroof in the locked position. The reason for verifying that both micro-switch switches click is that the micro-switch mounting assembly sometimes bends so that the cam will not make the micro-switches. If this happens you will have to remove the micro-switches and bend the mounting arm slightly so that the cam will make the micro-switches. The next thing to do is to mark the lifting arms for installation. If you look at the tracks on the sunroof that the lifting arms slide in to, you'll see a sharp bend almost like a knee. The middle of the curve of the knee is where the round peg on the lifting arm sits when the roof is in the locked position. With the roof installed and closed, lay one of the lifting arms in the track in the lifting element where in normally sits. The lifting element is the box that the lifting arm and the plastic gear sit in. Don't install the gear yet. Slide the element up into the track in the roof until the round peg is in the middle of the knee in the track. Put a mark on the lifting arm where it is lined up with the edge of the lifting element. Bright finger nail polish works well. Remove the lifting arm and mark the other lifting arm in the same spot. You can measure using a ruler, count the teeth on the lifting arm, or hold them side by side to figure out where to mark the other gear. If you've had sunroof gears strip, one of the critical things you must do is check the torque on the slip clutch. On later style sunroofs, this should be after installing and adjust the gears but before operating the roof to the full open or fully retracted position using the motor. Refer to BODY-03 for slip clutch adjustment. Now we're ready to install the gears. Remove the sunroof from the car. There should have been a thin metal washer on the back of the old gears. If it is not there it is probably still in the lifting element body. Make sure you put this washer on the back of the new gear before installing. Lubricate the gear with grease before installing. Porsche calls for a special grease (TL-VW 745 Universal Cold Grease). It should be available at the Porsche or Volkswagen dealer. I've never bought the special grease. I just use a good quality, fairly heavy grease. You don't need to apply an excessive amount. Install the gear in the lifting element housing. Insert the lifting arm so the mark on the lifting arm lines up with the edge of the housing (as we had previously measured). Screw the cover in place. Repeat for the other side. With the ignition key in position 1, carefully bump the up arrow on the console switch and watch the lifting arms. They should retract toward the lifting element housing as if you were going to remove the sunroof from the car. Be VERY careful here. Make sure that as you bump the lifting arms toward the retracted position, the round pegs on the lifting arms reach the element housing at the same time. When the pegs hit the housing, it acts as a mechanical stop. Due to uneven loading, the gears may strip if the arms do not hit the mechanical stop at the same time. Once you're sure everything is aligned and working correctly, install the sunroof and you're ready to go. I try to made sure the lifting arms are set perfectly and that the torque for the slip clutch is a little low. My gears have been in for about a year and have not stripped yet. And I remove my roof a lot in the summer time. When I first started working on sunroofs, I stripped several sets of gears while trying to get the arms set correctly. However, this was also before I knew how to check the torque on the slip clutch. That's why I told you to order two sets of gears. It's just a little insurance. I always like to keep a spare set of gears handy anyway. If you find that the roof doesn't lock down tight enough (i.e. the pegs on the arms aren't hitting the right part of the knee in the track) you can adjust this by moving the two micro-switches forward or backward. If you move them forward, the arm will stop more toward the released position. If you move them backward, they will stop more toward the raised position.

Suspension Dynamics To optimize the performance of your car's suspension it's essential to have an understanding of suspension dynamics. This includes and understanding of the concepts of &quot;oversteer&quot; and &quot;understeer&quot; and what must be done to correct these conditions when necessary. Now, I'm sure many of you know what oversteer and understeer are, but you may not have a complete understanding of what causes these conditions. Still others may have no idea what understeer and oversteer are. So, we'll start by discussing some suspension basics and work our way on from there. If you follow any type of auto racing, you may have overheard conversations between the driver and pit crew where the driver tells the crew that the car is &quot;pushing&quot; or the car is &quot;loose&quot;. There are actually referring to understeer (push) and oversteer (loose) conditions. During hard cornering the weight of the car shifts away from the inside wheels toward the outside wheels. The softer the suspension, the more weight is transferred to the outside wheels. The added weight on the outside wheels causes the outside tires to grip better allowing the car to steer safely through the turn. With a perfectly &quot;neutral&quot; suspension setup, the weight would transfer such that the front and rear tires would have the same amount of grip and, at the limit, both tires would lose traction at the same time. If the suspension is set up so that, during cornering more weight is shifted to the outside rear tire than the outside front tire, then the rear tire will have more grip during cornering than the front tire. So, the front tire will lose traction before the rear. This is referred to as understeer. The effect is that the car takes a wider radius curve than the drive intended. The reason you hear this referred to as &quot;pushing&quot; is that the driver feels the rear of the car trying to push the car off of it's intended line. Conversely, if the suspension is set up so that, during cornering more weight is shifted to the outside front tire than the outside rear tire, then the front tire will have more grip during cornering than the rear tire. So, the rear tire will lose traction before the front. This is referred to as oversteer or as the car being &quot;loose&quot;. The effect is that the rear wheels steer a wider path than the front wheels, rotating the car more than the driver intended, forcing the car into a smaller radius turn. Most passenger car suspensions are designed with a certain amount of understeer (including the 944) because it is much safer than oversteer. If the car understeers, the car makes a wider turn than intended, but the car remains stable. If the car oversteers, the car makes a smaller radius turn. This increases the cornering force on the outside wheels which brings the rear wheels even closer to the point of losing traction. This results in even more oversteer. If no correction is made, the situation will continue to become worse until the rear wheels lose grip completely, the car spins, and all control is lost. Realize that the above discussion assumes a constant velocity during cornering. Even in a car with a completely neutral suspension setup, you can induce oversteer or understeer via acceleration or braking during cornering. And, the effects of acceleration are different depending on whether the car has FWD or RWD. Ideal Setup? So, the big question you might ask right now is &quot;What is the ideal suspension response - oversteer, understeer, or neutral?&quot; The answer - all three. During straight line acceleration, a slight amount of understeer is desirable because it makes the car very stable, requiring few driver corrections to keep the car moving in a straight line. At the turn in point, you again want a slight understeer to keep the car stable while the brakes are being let off and cornering forces are building up. Through the apex, neutral steering is desirable as the car's cornering traction is at is maximum and it allows the car to drift through the corner should you come in a bit too hot (instead of having the front or rear lose traction in the middle of the turn). And finally, at the turn-out a slight amount of oversteer is desirable to allow the car to take a tighter path through the turn-out. Slip Angle and Suspension Dynamics Now we're going talk about oversteer and understeer using a new term called slip angle. The concept of slip angle is a little more complex. However, understanding slip angles is essential to understanding how acceleration and braking affect steering. When you're driving along in a straight line the car, wheels, and tires (including the tread on the tires) are all moving in the same direction. However, when you make a turn, the treads on the tire which are in contact with the ground (contact patch) resist the turning action due to friction between the tire and the ground. Due to the elasticity of the tires, the tread will distort creating an angular difference between the treads in the contact patch and the direction the wheel is turned. This angular difference is referred to as slip angle. When more weight is transferred to a particular tire, the slip angle increases because the tread in the contact patch area develops a higher resistance to turning (due to the increase in friction between the contact patch and the ground). So, when the slip angle of the rear tires is greater than the front tires you have oversteer. Likewise, when the slip angle of the front tires is greater than the rear you have understeer. And finally, when the slip angles are the same, you have neutral steer. So you ask, &quot;where is all this leading?&quot; Bear with me and hopefully it will all become a bit clearer shortly. Steering Response Under Acceleration As I mentioned before, acceleration and braking have an effect on steering dynamics. If we consider a neutral steering car that is cornering and we accelerate the car, tractive force from the engine is applied to the drive wheels. Tractive force is the force applied by the engine necessary to overcome the force of gravity and cause the car to move. This force is ultimately felt between the tire and the ground which causes the tread on the contact patch (already distorted from turning) to distort even more, thus increasing the slip angle for the drive wheels. As we stated, if the car had neutral steering before acceleration was applied, it will cause oversteer in a RWD car (increased slip angle in the rear tires) and understeer in a FWD car (increased slip angle in the front tires). Is it starting to make sense? Steering Response Under Braking During braking, there is a weight shift from the rear of the car toward the front of the car. This applies more weight to the front tires increasing the front tire slip angle and inducing oversteer. In this particular case, it's very easy to put the rear of the car into a spin if you enter a corner carrying too much speed, panic, and get on the brakes. The effect is similar if you're on the throttle in a fast corner and suddenly lift (take your foot off the gas). 911s are particularly bad about spinning out the rear if you lift in a turn due to the high concentration of weight behind the rear wheels. At my first PCA Driver Education event, the only two cars I saw get in trouble were 911s drivers who lifted in a corner. BTW, the driver's were DE instructors. Handling Corrections Now that we've discussed what oversteer and understeer are and what causes each, let's take a look at what can be done to correct oversteer or understeer conditions. Understeer Corrections Front Suspension Rear Suspension Softer front springs Stiffer rear springs Thinner or no front sway bar Rear sway bar or a thicker one Raise front tire pressure Lower rear tire pressure Softer front shocks Stiffer rear shocks More negative front camber More positive rear camber Remove weight from the front Add weight to the rear More down force in the front Less down force in the rear Wider tires in the front Narrower tires in the rear More positive caster. Limited slip rear differential or stiffer rear diff Oversteer Corrections Front Suspension Rear Suspension Stiffer front springs Softer rear springs Front sway bar or a thicker one Thinner or no rear sway bar Lower front tire pressure Higher rear tire pressure More positive front camber More negative rear camber Add weight to the front Remove weight from the rear Less down force in the front More down force in the rear Narrower tires in the front Wider Tires in the rear Stiffer front shocks Softer rear shocks 944 Suspension and Handling Setups Now that we've discussed the basics of handling in general, let's take a look at specific setups for the 944. There are a number of different ways to approach suspension setup. There are no hard and fast rules about combinations of springs, sway bars, and torsion bars. To find the right combination for what you want to do with the car, it may involve a lot of trial and error. Bottom line is it's all about establishing and maintaining a relative balance between the front and rear suspension such that there's not too much understeer nor too much oversteer. Ideally, you want the steering to be as neutral as possible. For 944s, and almost all street cars in general, the car is going to have some amount of understeer from the factory. The reason is that when a car oversteers, your normal &quot;street driver&quot; tend to get into trouble more frequently with a car that oversteers as they tend to overcorrect in panic situations on the street. Therefore, understeer is considered safer. Driver's who spend a lot of time on the track tend to want a car that is neutral or has a slight oversteer and they get a better feel for how the car is handling under those conditions and hence can maintain better control over the car when driving it at it's limits. To gain some perspective on making changes to the 944 suspension, it's valuable to first look at several stock suspension setup and discuss their performance characteristics under different conditions. The information in this table was obtained from a suspension article in Excellence magazine written by Jim Pasha. However, it has been modified to include torsion bar spring rate information and 968 M030 information.

Realize that this is based on solid torsion bars. For hollow torsion bars, the spring rate is based on the outside diameter of the torsion bar and the diameter of the hollow area inside the bar. For these bars, you'll have to get the spring rate from the manufacturer. Torsion Bar Rates Diameter Spring Rate (lbs./in) 22.0 97 22.5 106 23.0 116 23.5 126 24.0 137 24.5 149 25.0 161 25.5 175 26.0 189 27.0 220 28.0 254 29.0 292 30.0 335 31.0 382 32.0 434 33.0 490 Notice that some of the rates for the front springs in the first table are given in lbf and some are given in Newtons (N). For the rates given in lbs., it's for an uncompressed spring. For the rates given in Newtons, it's for springs compressed to their normal operating height. As the compressed height may vary from vehicle-to-vehicle comparing the spring rates above are useful only to the point of comparing one vehicle to another. So, without some fixed point of reference how do we know what kinds of changes to make to our suspension? Basically, changing to higher spring rates for the front springs, torsion bars, and sway bars can benefit all vehicles in the 924/944/968 model line. The main benefit of changing to higher spring rates is reducing body roll during cornering. By reducing body roll, the tires maintain contact with the road longer. Other benefits are reduced squat during acceleration and reduced dive during hard braking. Regardless of the spring rates listed above (in lbs. or Newtons), the maximum spring rate for any 924/944/968 suspension is approximately 175 lbs. So, we need to pick a spring that is something greater than 175 lbs. if we want to improve handling. So, exactly how much do we increase the spring rate? Generally, spring rates from 200 to 220 lbs. provide a good performance improvement cars that are primarily street driven. For street cars that see some track time, spring rates from 250-275 lbs. are an excellent choice. I have seen some cars where 400 lb. springs are used on street/track cars. In my opinion, 400 lb. springs are entirely too stiff for a street driven car. They provide much too harsh a ride on the street. More importantly, as streets are generally much less smooth and hence much less forgiving than a track, they can in fact be dangerous on the street. To give you some idea of the stiffness of a 400 lb. spring, 944 Turbo Cup cars used 375-410 lb. progressive rate springs. Example Suspension Setups Sport Suspension A good sport suspension setup for a car that is primarily driven on the street might include 220 lb. front springs, 27 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Personally, I like a car that has very neutral steering characteristics. If you prefer to maintain the understeering characteristics of the stock 944, you might prefer a 26 mm sway bar to the 27 mm. If you prefer a car that oversteers, you might choose a 28 mm torsion bar. Just realize that a car that oversteers is much more sensitive to steering corrections and can you into trouble during a panic maneuver. With regards to the sway bars, I really like the 968 M030 sway bars. The reason I like them is that the 19 mm rear bars are 3-way adjustable which give you another option when it comes to changing the steering characteristics. High Performance Street/Track Suspension A good high performance suspension for a car that it used on the street and track might include 260 lb. springs, a 28 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Again, if you want more understeer, you might choose a 27 mm torsion bar. And, if you want some oversteer, you might choose a 29 mm torsion bar. As I've already cautioned you about oversteer we won't repeat that again. Full Race Suspension While I've seen this suspension setup used on the street, I don't recommend it. A good combination for the track might include 400 lb. front springs, 31 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Additional Suspension Notes and Suggestions When you decide to change the suspension of a 944 and you make the decision to change the torsion bars, you have to realize that changing a torsion bar yourself is not necessarily a job for the novice mechanic. It's not that the job is all that difficult. It is very tedious because the torsion bars must be properly indexed to achieve the proper ride height. Indexing the torsion bars may involve a lot of trial and error to get the proper ride height which includes driving the car at a given torsion bar index for a day or so to allow the suspension to settle. For that reason, it may be more practical to go to a suspension setup that uses coil over shocks in the rear and remove the torsion bars completely. It is also becoming more common to see suspensions that use a combination of torsion bars and coil over shocks in the rear to achieve an overall rear spring rate that will balance whatever springs you use in the front. By doing that, you can leave the rear torsion bars alone and simply choose a coil over shock to match your new spring rate in the front. However, if you choose to do away with the torsion bars or use a torsion bar/coil over combination, you must select a coil over shock that has adjustable spring perches so that you can adjust the ride height. The primary disadvantage of going to a coil over setup in the rear is that it's much more expensive than simply changing the rear torsion bar. Up to this point, we really haven't discussed shocks or struts at all. The factory shocks and struts are adequate for street use. However, I like an adjustable sport shock/strut setup, even for street use. Personally, I prefer Koni Sport shocks/struts because that's what I've become accustomed to over the years. However, Bilstein makes good sport shocks/struts as well. For use on the track, a full coil over setup (front and rear) is the only way to go in my opinion. Closing Comments Realize that, due to the large number of variables that can affect a car's handling, no two cars are going to respond exactly the same to the same change in suspension components. Likewise, no two drivers will have the exact same feel for the same suspension. The idea is to get to a suspension setup that is right for you. What's right for you may not be right for me. The suggested setups above should get you close to a fairly neutral handling setup. However, it may not get your car exactly where you want your handling to be. From there you should be able to &quot;tweak&quot; the suspension feel to get to &quot;your&quot; suspension setup by making minor changes in weight distribution, shock stiffness (assuming you go with adjustable shocks/struts), camber, caster, and tire pressure. Hope this article gives you some idea as to what direction to head with your suspension modifications. Drive it like you stole it!

Overcooling problems are causes by a thermostat that is stuck open while overheating problems by a thermostat that is either stuck closed or does not open at the correct coolant temperature. There are two different thermostats for the 924S, 944, and 944 Turbo. The correct thermostat is determined by whether you have a new type water pump or old type water pump. With the old style thermostat, the groove for the thermostat snap ring is 4.5 mm from the thermostat sealing surface inside the water pump housing. With the new style, the groove is 7 mm from the sealing surface.

Have a large enough catch pan for approximately 2 gallons of coolant and catch rags to clean up any spilled coolant. Remove the cooling hose going from the water pump to the bottom of the radiator. Using angled snap ring pliers, remove the thermostat retaining snap ring. This can be very difficult and requires a lot of patience. Remove the old thermostat from the pump housing. The thermostat has an sealing o-ring and a spacer washer. Both should come out with the thermostat. If desired, the old thermostat can be checked using the Testing section below. Install new thermostat with o-ring and spacer washer into the pump housing. Install the snap ring into the pump housing. Bear in mind that correctly orienting the holes on the snap ring can make removal of the snap ring much easier if the thermostat needs to be replaced in the future. Generally, the holes in the snap ring should be oriented toward the top of the pump housing or toward the bottom. Install the cooling hose from the water pump to the radiator.

Realize that this temperature will likely be in °C. Place the thermostat in a cooking container filled with water and place a thermostat in the water. Place the container on a heat source and heat the water until it reaches the temperature stamped on the thermostat. When this temperature is reached, the thermostat should be fully open. Remove the container from the heat source and allow it to cool. The thermostat should be fully closed when the temperature decreases to approximately 10 degrees below the rated temperature. If the thermostat does not operate as described above, it should be replaced.

Because they can result in such a large number of problems, faulty switches often go undiagnosed. The other thing that makes TPS problems difficult to diagnose is that they quite often only appear when the engine is warmed up (throttle position switch warmed up). The following lists some of the symptoms that MAY indicate a problem with the throttle position switch: Poor idle - particularly a high idle condition Engine cuts out to an idle condition during acceleration Poor power at various RPMs (various throttle positions) Surging idle Misfire Stumble during acceleration Intermittent boost problems (turbocharged cars) Tools Multimeter Test leads Phillips screwdriver Testing NOTE On 1985.5 and newer cars, the DME control unit is located behind the kick panel in the passenger's footwell. For pre-1985.5 cars, the DME is located under the dash on the driver's side. For 8V Normally Aspirated cars: Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME. Connect an ohmmeter between terminal 2 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will test the idle speed contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (&infin;). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). Connect the ohmmeter between terminal 3 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will test the wide open throttle (WOT) contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read infinite (&infin;). With the throttle wide open the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. The switch in resistance should occur just before the throttle reaches full open. If reading at the DME plug are unsatisfactory, the test should be repeated at the switch. This will require removing the throttle body from the car. The ohmmeter should be connected between the center terminal on the switch (ground) and each of the outer terminals (2 and 3) and resistance values checked as described above. For 16V Normally Aspirated cars: NOTE The 16V N/A cars use the same TPS as the early cars. Pictures of the 16V DME plug will be available in a few days. Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 52 and 24 on the DME wiring harness plug. This will test the idle speed contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read 0 - 10 ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (&infin;). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). Connect the ohmmeter between terminals 53 and 24 on the DME wiring harness plug. This will test the wide open throttle (WOT) contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read infinite (&infin;). With the throttle approximately 2/3 open, the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. If reading at the DME plug are unsatisfactory, the test should be repeated at the switch. This will require removing the throttle body from the car. The ohmmeter should be connected between the center terminal on the switch (ground) and each of the outer terminals (2 and 3) and resistance values checked as described above. For turbocharged cars: Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME control unit. Connect an ohmmeter between terminal 2 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will check the idle contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read between 0 - 10 ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (&infin;). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). Disconnect the electrical connector for the KLR control unit. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 22 and 23 on the KLR wiring harness plug. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read between 320 - 670 ohms. Slowly open the throttle to the wide open throttle (WOT) position. As the throttle opens, the resistance should continuously increase to full open resistance without any breaks. Full open resistance is 2.7 - 4.7 Kohms. Replacement and Adjustment Normally Aspirated cars: Remove the throttle body from the car. Remove the two Phillips head screws that attach the TPS to the throttle body. Install the new TPS and insert the mounting screws. Do not tighten the screws until the adjustment is complete. Hold the throttle in the closed position and turn the TPS until the internal stop is felt and tighten the mounting screws. Check the adjustment by turning the throttle toward the open position. An audible click should be hear as soon as the throttle starts to open. Slowly close the throttle until it is fully closed. Do not force the throttle closed. Allow it to close under spring pressure only. Just prior to going fully closed, an audible click should again be heard. If the click is not heard, readjust the switch. Install the throttle body. Turbocharged cars: NOTE On turbocharged cars, the throttle body does not have to be removed from the car. However, the bottom mounting screw for the TPS is extremely difficult to remove and install. So, I always replace the Phillips head screws the 4 mm Allen head bolts. They are much easier to remove and install than the Phillips screws - especially if you have a long ball head Allen tool. Remove the two Phillips head screws that attach the TPS to the throttle body. Install the new TPS and insert the mounting screws. Do not tighten the screws until the adjustment is complete. Hold the throttle in the closed position and turn the TPS until the internal stop is felt and tighten the mounting screws. Check the adjustment by turning the throttle toward the open position. An audible click should be hear as soon as the throttle starts to open. Slowly close the throttle until it is fully closed. Do not force the throttle closed. Allow it to close under spring pressure only. Just prior to going fully closed, an audible click should again be heard. If the click is not heard, readjust the switch.

Procedure NOTE When setting the engine to TDC on the compression stroke for cylinder #1, you must realize that the crankshaft rotates twice for every single rotation of the camshaft. So, if you simply set the crankshaft to TDC without looking at the position of the camshaft, you may actually be at TDC on the exhaust stroke for cylinder #1. So, after you get the crankshaft (by flywheel indication or by checking actual piston location), check the camshaft sprocket to make sure the camshaft alignment mark is at the TDC position as well. This procedure can be performed by one person. However, it is much easier to perform with two people. At the back of the engine compartment, looking from the left side of the car, locate the square opening (window) in the top of the clutch housing. You will be looking for the letters &quot;OT&quot; to appear in the opening as the engine is rotated. Note:&#9;The crankshaft should not be rotated, manually or otherwise, unless the timing belt is installed with timing properly set or the camshaft housing assembly removed. This is done to prevent valve/piston damage. Using the 15/16&quot; or 24 mm deep socket and ratchet, rotate the engine in the clockwise direction using the crankshaft pulley bolt on the front of the engine until the letters &quot;OT&quot; appear in the clutch housing window. NOTE The picture below was taken on my own car. The &quot;OT&quot; is not really visible in the clutch housing opening due to the rust on my flywheel. However, some time ago, I painted the TDC line on my flywheel with red fingernail polish so it would be clearly visible. From the angle this picture is taken it appears that the alignment mark is slightly off from the alignment tab in clutch housing but it's simply due to the angle. To correctly align the mark for TDC you need to be looking directly down on the opening. Many people have trouble locating the opening in the clutch housing for the TDC mark. You'll note in the picture the close proximity of the opening to the speed/reference sensor mounting bracket (sensors removed in this picture). NOTE In the picture below, you'll see what the &quot;OT&quot; mark would look like on the flywheel if it is clean (unlike the previous picture). Note: If this is being performed by one person, the alignment mark on the camshaft sprocket can be used to determine when the engine is close to Top Dead Center (TDC). However, the flywheel should be used for final alignment in case the timing is off slightly. The camshaft sprocket alignment mark is visible through the opening in the front distributor housing cover just above the distributor cap. When the letters &quot;OT&quot; are visible in the window, continue to rotate the engine clockwise until the scribe mark (line) beside the &quot;OT&quot; is aligned with the tab inside the window. The tab is on the side of the window closest to the middle of the car and extends down from the inside of the housing until it almost touches the flywheel. If you have trouble locating the TDC mark from above, there is a 5 mm wide groove in the flywheel which can be used to locate TDC as well. It will appear in an opening in the bottom of the clutch housing near the starter. When the groove is centered in the opening the #1 cylinder is at TDC. Personally, I don't care for this method because if the groove is not centered in the opening, the timing can be off &#177; 1 tooth. Alternatively, you can remove the #1 spark plug and insert a small diameter wooden dowel into the spark plug hole until it contacts the top of the piston. As the engine is rotated, the piston will force the dowel upward. When the end of the dowel is at its highest point, the engine is at TDC for the #1 cylinder. If the engine is not in the car and the clutch housing is removed, the &quot;OT&quot; scribe mark on the flywheel will line up with a cast mark on the back of the upper crankcase section when the #1 cylinder is at TDC. If the crankshaft pulley bolt needs to be removed or it is important that the engine remain at the TDC position, you'll need to install the &quot;engine in&quot; flywheel lock (9206). There is also an &quot;engine out&quot; flywheel lock (9130) which is used if the engine is on an engine stand. The engine out flywheel lock is not intended to maintain the engine at TDC but, is attached the flywheel to provide counter-torque against the engine stand arms for removing/installing the crankshaft pulley bolt or removing/installing the flywheel cheesehead bolts.

Raise the vehicle on jack stands. Remove both rear wheels. Remove the exhaust system as follows: On N/A cars remove the exhaust system from the flange at the exhaust manifolds back. On turbocharged cars remove the exhaust system from the turbocharger outlet downpipe flange (just above the O2 sensor) back. NOTE The procedure and pictures that follow show the suspension being lowered after the transaxle has already been removed. It has been suggested that lowering the suspension first may make the transaxle removal easier. However, you'll likely find dropping the suspension first will not give you enough room to crawl up under the car to remove the transaxle. Using TRANS-03, remove the transaxle from the vehicle. Remove the shifter rod. Lower the rear suspension as follows: Place jack stands or blocks under the swing arms. Remove the front two bolts (one on each side of the vehicle) that hold the rear suspension to the chassis. Next, remove the four bolts (two on each side of the vehicle) half way up the wheel arch and the two bolts (one on each side of the vehicle) at the top of the wheel arch. Loosen the bottom shock mount. Disconnect wires and brake lines as necessary to lower the rear suspension without damaging them.     You can now lower the rear suspension. However, the rear brake lines will limit the amount that you can lower the suspension. You may have to disconnect the brake lines to obtain enough clearance to remove the torque tube. Resting the lower suspension on blocks or bricks works well. NOTE It may be necessary to remove the starter and slave cylinder in order to access all the bolts / fasteners for the torque tube and torque tube carrier. Remove the four bolts that connect the torque tube to the clutch housing. Disconnect the torque tube carriers. Lower the torque tube and move towards the rear of the car. If you're working with a late model 944 (dog ears on the torque tube), you will have to rotate the torque 180° to remove it from the car.    Rebuilding Measure the distance from the transmission end of the drive shaft to the bellhousing end of the tube and record it. This is so the drive shaft end can later be reinstalled to the correct depth in the torque tube. Get a 6 foot long piece of standard black or galvanized 1/2&quot; steel plumbing pipe at the hardware store. Slip the end of this pipe over the pilot diameter at the front of the drive shaft. Use a large hammer to pound the shaft out, towards the bellhousing side of the torque tube. The steel plumbing pipe is soft and will not damage the heat-treated splined drive shaft. Once the shaft has been removed, you will need the following: A 6-foot long 3/4-10 threaded rod Five 3/4-10 nuts Two thick flat washers which will fit inside the tube I.D. and reasonably close to the O.D. of the threaded rod (I used heavy-duty fender washers). I went to Lowe's in their specialty bolts section. A flat bar or spacer of steel with a 1&quot; hole in it (I used an old go-cart engine sprocket - anything which has a 1&quot; hole in it and is larger than the small end of the torque tube which can be pressed against without deflecting will work). Slide the spacer or the large washer on one end of the threaded rod, then lock two nuts together near the end of the rod. You may find it works well to place a large socket in front of the washers to act as a &quot;driver&quot; to pull the bearings out. Slide the rod into the tranny bellhousing end of the torque tube. Put the go-cart pulley or the flat bar with 1&quot; hole onto the protruding end of the threaded rod at the front of the torque tube. Add a washer and nut. This nut will be held stationary with a wrench. Alternatively, if you have a welder, you can tack weld the nut to the flat bar. Lock two nuts together at the protruding end of the threaded rod in front of the torque tube. Hold the ¾&quot; nut which bears against the pulley or flat bar with a 1&quot; hole with a wrench. Use an impact wrench to &quot;spin&quot; the two locked nuts at the front of the threaded rod, spinning it counterclockwise. This drags the washer at the bellhousing end forward, accumulating the 4 bearings as it goes. Can also do this by hand, but it takes forever. Alternatively, if you don't have an impact wrench, you can simply turn the ¾&quot; nut against the flat bar with an open end or combination wrench. Again, it will take a long time. The picture below shows a puller with a flat bar on the end and one with a go-cart pulley.     After so many turns (a million), presto - out pop all 4 torque tube bearing assemblies. NOTES After removing these, their construction is evident - they are standard sealed ball bearings FAG 6006 2Z that are pressed into stamped steel carriers with rubber splines molded onto the O.D. There are also little rubber-covered inner sleeves that are pressed into the I.D. of the sealed bearings, that are staked in 4 places. You need to &quot;unstake&quot; the sleeves and remove them, then press the bearings out of the carriers, and press in new ones. On older 944s, the bearing carriers are two-pieces that are riveted together. You'll need to drill the rivets out and separate the two halves of the carrier to remove the bearing. If the rubber coated inner sleeves are intact, once you've pressed them out of the bearings, save them for reuse. However, if they are shattered or are in otherwise poor condition, you'll need to have new sleeves fabricated. I went to a machine shop to have them fabricate 4 of the inner sleeves out of Delrin plastic (see drawing below). I used a hydraulic press to install the new bearings and inner sleeves. Install the bearing assemblies and drive shaft in the torque tube as follows:. Measure and mark 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th bearing locations in the torque tube with 1st in front. Use bearing marks in the shaft. All 4 bearing housings must be in same orientation. Look at the attached dwg. Position inner sleeve in a way it will not come out when the shaft is driven from the front end of torque tube. Whether you are reusing the old sleeves or using new ones. Install 2nd bearing in the front end using the 3/4&quot; all threaded rod until it is in the second bearing mark. Then do the 1st bearing. Then install the 3rd and 4th bearing from the back end. I did it this way so I don't have to install one bearing from the front end all the way to the back end. That is a lot of wrenching. I put some loctite anti-seize inside the torque tube so bearing will slide easy. Insert the drive shaft into torque tube from the front end inserting the tranny end first. I used a plastic mallet to tap it in. Once it hit the 4th bearing it got a little stiff so I had to use a 1/2&quot; x 2&quot; pipe inserted in the pilot bearing end then hit it with a ball peen hammer (not too hard!). Position the shaft based on the measurement before disassembly. The key here is to have the sleeve ID to have the right tolerance fit. If it's too tight, you have to hammer the shaft really hard to drive it in thus destroying the ball bearings due to shock load during installation. If it is too loose, it may not last long and vibrate soon. Installation Slide the torque tube back into position in the vehicle. Remember, if this is a later torque tube with dog ears, the transaxle will have to be rotated 180° from its normal orientation to get it to slide into position. When the torque tube is in position such that the front flange is near the clutch housing, rotate the torque tube back to its normal orientation (if it's a torque tube with dog ears). Then move the torque tube forward until the drive shaft slides into the pressure plate and clutch disc and the torque tube flange is flush with the clutch housing. Support the back end of the torque tube with a jack stand. Install the torque tube carriers and the retaining bolts (4) for the torque tube to clutch housing flange. Raise the rear suspension and install retaining bolts. Reattach and lines that were disconnected when the suspension was lowered. Attach the lower shock mounts to the suspension. Using TRANS-03, install the transaxle. Install wheels and tighten lug nuts.

However, reindexing the torsion after completion is a pain and can be very time consuming. There are a couple of reasons for removing the torsion bars. The first is to make a ride height adjustment and the second is to upgrade to a stiffer torsion bar. I was fortunate enough to come across a very good torsion bar replacement procedure written by Marc Belanger to use as a guide. The following procedure is based on my own experience and the shared experiences of Marc, Doug Donsbach, and others. These combined experiences should provide you with a pretty clear picture of what it takes to remove, replace, and reindex the torsion bars in your car. I'll also be adding some pictures to help guide you along the way. Refer to the diagram below for location of the major components and fasteners for the rear suspension. First off, if you think you need to make a change in ride height, you first need to take a ride height measurement and determine how much of a change is needed. Typically, the best place to take a ride height measurement is from the ground up to the top-center of the fender well (i.e. centered on the wheel). A good number to use for ride height measurement at that point is about 25 inches (63,5 cm). It's really not a great idea to go much lower than that. And, you'll achieve the best results if you keep the same ride height front-to-rear. If you determine that a change in ride height is in order, a small amount of adjustment is available via the eccentric bolt on the trailing arm spring plate. The amount of adjustment available depends on where the eccentric is set to begin with. The total adjustment range is approximately 1 inch (2,5 cm). Assuming the eccentric is centered (seldom the case), you'll only be able to raise or lower the ride height by about 1/2 inch. 944 Rear Suspension Tools Jack Stands and Floor Jack Metric Socket and Combination Wrench Set Pry bar Other Procedures Needed SUSP-05, Rear Sway Bar Removal and Installation Removal NOTE You should have already determined the pre-existing ride height as described in the introduction section. NOTE If you are simply reindexing existing torsion bars, proceed to Step 6. Steps 1-5 are only required when installing different torsion bars. Raise the rear of the vehicle. Using SUSP-05, remove the rear sway bar and drop links. Lower the vehicle back to the ground and bounce the rear of the car several times to get the suspension to settle. Fabricate a measuring device similar to the one show in the figure below to allow measurement of the position of the spring plate in relation to the torsion tube chassis mount (end cap). I believe Doug Donsbach originally came up with this idea. Basically, the device has two holes that correspond to the bottom two bolts on the end cap to give a point of reference. With the vehicle sitting on the ground, measure the height of the spring plate in relation to the torsion tube end cap and mark the position on the measuring device (see below). This is the loaded spring plate height. This will be a bit awkward with the wheel in place and the car sitting on the ground. Raise the rear of the vehicle and place it on jack stands. Remove the rear wheels. Unload the torsion bar by removing the bottom rear bolt (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 5) on the torsion bar chassis mount (end cap). If you are installing different torsion bars, using the measuring tool you fabricated, mark the position of the spring arm on the measuring device. This is the unloaded spring arm position. Disconnect the rear brake lines at the calipers. Unplug the brake pad wear sensors. Unbolt and disconnect both rear axles from their trailing arms. Hang them out of the way using bungie cords or wire. Remove the bolt that attaches the trailing arm to the torsion tube bolt (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 1 - one bolt on each trailing arm). Support the trailing arms from the transmission crossmember using a heavy duty strap. A good quality strap is called for as the trailing arm and rotor assembly is fairly heavy . It will become damaged, damage other components, or worse yet, injure you if it is not properly supported. The trailing arm assembly will be hanging freely when the spring plate bolts are removed in the next step. Remove the nuts and bolts that hold the trailing arm to the spring plate (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 2 - three nuts and bolts on each trailing arm). Note that the back two bolts are eccentric bolts used to adjust the height of the trailing arm. You may have to tap on the end of the eccentric bolt where the retaining nut was removed to free it from the spring plate. Remove the nut and bolt that holds the torsion tube cantilever arm to the chassis mount near the top of the wheel well (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 3 - one bolt and nut on each trailing arm). Place the floor jack underneath the center of the torsion tube assembly. Raise the jack until it just contacts the torsion tube assembly. Remove the nut and bolt that attaches the torsion tube chassis mount to the body of the vehicle (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 4 - one nut and bolt on each trailing arm chassis mount). Gently pry on the torsion tube assembly, alternating sides, until the assembly is free from the body. Lower the assembly on the floor jack far enough to slide the torsion bar out of the torsion tube once the torsion tube assembly chassis mounts and spring plates are removed. The torsion tube chassis mount has four bolts which attach it to the torsion tube. Remove the remaining three bolts in the torsion tube chassis mount. Remove the torsion tube chassis mount and spring plate. Pull the torsion bar out of the torsion tube. Replacing Determine the old torsion bar loaded-to-unloaded range on the measuring device which you fabricated during the torsion bar removal (distance between the two marks). NOTE If you are replacing a solid torsion bar with a hollow torsion bar, the manufacturer should supply a solid diameter that the hollow bar is equivalent to. Use the solid bar equivalent diameter in the calculation below. Calculate the new torsion bar loaded-to-unloaded range using the formula below: Example: Let's assume you currently have 25.5mm torsion bars and want to swap to 30mm bars and that the loaded-to-unloaded range on your old bar is 50mm. The loaded-to-unloaded range for your new bar would be calculated as follows: Using the loaded-to-unloaded range for the new bar, measure that distance down from the loaded mark (top mark) on your measuring device and make a mark on the device at that point. This is the new bar unloaded position. Install the new torsion bar into the torsion tube. Install the spring plate and torsion tube end cap on to the torsion tube. Use the measuring device to check that the spring plate is aligned to the new bar unloaded position when installing the spring plate. Install at least two bolts into the end cap to hold it in position while the ride height is being checked. When both torsion bars have been replaced, raise the torsion tube assembly into position using the floor jack. Bolt the trailing arms to the spring plates ensuring the eccentric adjusting bolt is centered. Bolt the trailing arm to the torsion tube. Attach the torsion tube cantilever arm to the chassis mount near the top of the wheel well. Attach the torsion tube chassis mount (end cap) to the chassis. Remove the vehicle from the jack stands, bounce the rear end of the car several times, and check the ride height. If the ride height needs adjusting and it is with &#177; 1/2&quot;, adjust the eccentric bolt on the spring plate to obtain the desired ride height. If the needed ride height adjustment is greater than 1/2&quot;, unbolt and lower the torsion bar assembly, reindex the torsion bars as described in the section that follows, reinstall the assembly, and check the ride height again. Repeat this as necessary until the correct ride height is obtained. Do not be surprised if it takes you three or more times to achieve the correct right height. This is very common. Also, do not be surprised if you have to reindex the bars several days after completion once everything has had a chance to settle completely. Once the correct ride height is obtained, complete the reassembly by installing any remaining bolts in the torsion tube end caps and installing the rear sway bar. Indexing the Torsion Bars Indexing the torsion bars on a 944 is tedious at best, but fortunately it isn't rocket science. However, after the following explanation of how torsion bar indexing works it may seem like rocket science. If you've never studied geometry, this may completely new to you. However, bear with me and we will ultimately arrive at some formulas you will be able to use regardless of whether you understand circular geometry. First, we have to understand that in geometry a circle is divided into increments called degrees (°) and that there are 360 degrees in a complete circle. Each degree is divided into increments called minutes and there are 60 minutes (') in each degree. Now, if you examine a 944 torsion bar, you'll find that the inner end of the torsion bar has 40 splines and the outer end of the bar has 44 splines. So, if we take the number of degrees in a circle and divide it by the number of splines, will find the amount of rotation that can be obtained by moving the bar 1 spline. For the inner torsion bar end: For the outer torsion bar end: The measured length of the trailing arm on a 944 is 16.5&quot; from the center of the torsion bar out to the center of the hub. Since we now know the length of the trailing arm and the number of degrees of rotation for each tooth of spline movement, we can now use fairly simple geometry for right triangles to calculate the change in ride height with each change in spline position. Using the formulas for right triangles below, we can calculate the change in ride height (X1). Where: A = Length of Side adjacent to angle theta (&#952;) O = Length of Side opposite angle H = Length of the Hypotenuse So, for the inner tie rod spline movement we get: Now for the part that may be a little harder to follow. This calculation is based on the assumption that we are dealing with a perfect right triangle. And, if you've ever studied geometry, you'll remember that the longest side of a right triangle is the hypotenuse. In our case with the trailing arm, the hypotenuse is simply the trailing arm moved from one position to another. Since the change in ride height calculation is based on the end of the trailing arm dropping straight down at a right angle from it's original position, our calculation is somewhat flawed. In reality, the hub end of the trailing arm swings along the arc of a circle. For it to drop straight down at a right angle from it's original position, the trailing arm would have to change length and we know that isn't possible. Unless, if course, Porsche comes up with something similar to Variocam for the suspension system. Anyway, we can still use the right triangle rules to come up with the actual ride height change if we do a few more calculations. If we calculate the length of the hypotenuse at any given angle theta, that will give us the theoretical length that the trailing arm would have to lengthen to in order to maintain our right triangle. Then, we can use the difference between the theoretical trailing arm length and the actual length to form a new (smaller) right triangle which will allow us to determine the error introduced into our original calculation. I know that's hard to visualize but, bear with me. So, let's first calculate the length of the hypotenuse (X2) given that angle &#952; = 9° or one tooth on the inner torsion bar spline: If we take the difference between the hypotenuse length at angle &#952; and the actual trailing arm length, we obtain a length (X3) which we can use as the hypotenuse of a new (smaller) triangle. We can now use the angle &#952; and the length of the new hypotenuse to determine the error (X4) in our original calculation. And finally, we can calculate the actual change in ride height (X5) for inner spline movement by subtracting the error (X4) from the original ride height change (X1): This is approximately 6.6 cm of change in ride height. Using the same calculations and substituting in 8.18° for angle &#952;, we obtain the actual ride height change for a single spline rotation on the outer torsion bar splines. That's roughly 6 cm. Now that we know just how much or a change in ride will occur per spline on each end of the torsion bar, let's take a look at a specific example. Assume we're standing beside the driver's side of the car looking at the torsion bar end and spring plate (see picture below). If we leave the spring plate and chassis mount attached to the outer end of the torsion bar and rotate the inner end of the bar one spline in the counter-clockwise direction, it will raise the end of the spring plate. This will lower the ride height of the car by 2.58&quot;. Then if we leave the inner end fixed in the torsion tube and rotate the spring plate and chassis mount one spline in the clockwise direction it will lower the end of the spring plate and raise the ride height of the car by 2.35&quot;. The net result will be that the car is 0.23&quot; lower (or approximately 6mm).

Better, but more expensive alternatives to the standard transmission oil (IMHO) are Redline Synthetic MTL, Swepco 201, or Mobil 1 75W/90 gear oil. There was some discussion several years ago with regards to Mobil 1 gear oil attacking bronze synchros. However, there's never been anything to my knowledge to support that. Regardless of which of these three you choose, you'll probably notice a marked improvement in transmission shifting and noise, especially when the transaxle is cold. Tools 17 mm Allen head socket / hex key Jack Stands and Floor Jack OR Ramps Transmission Fluid (Approximately 2.75 quarts or 2.6 liters) Drain pan (At least 1 gallon) 4 feet of hose (type not important) Funnel Procedure Drive the car for about 5 -10 miles to warm up the transmission fluid. Raise the rear of the car on jack stands or ramps. I prefer jack stands as they give more room to work around the transaxle. Using the 17 mm Allen head socket or hex key, remove the transaxle fill plug. The fill and drain plugs are located on the left hand side of the transaxle. The fill plug is the upper plug. It's important to remove the fill plug first because if you drain the transaxle first and then can't get the fill plug out....... Well, you get the picture. It's also a good idea to warm the new transaxle fluid before you put it into the transaxle. Heating allows the fluid to flow more easily into the transaxle. Try placing the transmission oil containers in front of a halogen heat lamp for about 20 minutes. DO NOT heat in a microwave. Place a drain pan under the transaxle below the drain plug. Remove the drain plug to drain the transaxle. When the transaxle is completely drained, install the drain plug and torque to 24 Nm (18 ft-lbs). Route the hose over the top of the left rear wheel, over the top of the exhaust, to the fill hole on the transaxle. Using the funnel, pour the new transaxle fluid into hose and into the transaxle until the fluid level is just below the bottom of the fill hole (6-8 mm). Personally, I fill to the bottom of the fill hole. Install the fill plug and torque to 24 Nm (18 ft-lbs). Lower vehicle.

The follow procedure will describe how to check the shift linkages for 944s and 968s. We'll also look at repairing a worn shifter. Refer to the pictures below for shift linkage component locations. The locations are given in the procedures below within parenthesis with 944 parts shown first. 944 SHIFT LINKAGE 944 Shifter / Linkage Parts Shifter Parts Part Number Description Drawing ID 477 711 205 D Shift Lever 1 N 012 437 3 Lock Washer 16 944 424 229 00 Bearing Shell 10 Transaxle Linkage 944 424 013 00 Intermediate Shift Lever 18 477 711 147 A Ball Pin (2 required) 28 968 SHIFT LINKAGE 968 Shifter / Linkage Parts Shifter Parts Part Number Description Drawing ID 944 424 015 02 Shift Lever 1 N 012 648 2 Spring Clip 17 944 424 231 00 Bearing Shell 12 Transaxle Linkage 944 424 013 01 Intermediate Shift Lever 21 999 167 046 00 Ball Pin (2 required) 29 944 424 041 02 Articulated Shaft 30 Removing and Checking the Shift Lever Sloppy shifting can be the result of a worn shifter (1) pin or a broken bearing shell (10, 12). On the 968 shifter, there's also two bushings (19) for the shifter pin which may be worn and need replacing. On early 944s with carpet on the console underneath the shift lever perform the following (Refer to 944 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): Pull up on the bottom of the leather shift lever boot (7) to separate it from the rubber inner boot (6). Pull up the carpet around the rubber boot. Slide a small flat tip screwdriver under the edge of the trim piece at the base of the rubber boot. Push on the clips with the screwdriver to remove the trim piece. Pull up on the rubber shift boot to separate it from the shifter sound absorber (8). Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip (2) which holds the shift knob (3) to the shift lever (1). Pull up on the shift knob to remove the knob and boot from the shift lever. Remove the rubber inner boot from the shift lever. Go To Step 4. On later 944s with plastic trim around the shifter boot perform the following (Refer to 944 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): Using a flat tip screwdriver gently pry around the base of the shifter boot (7) next to the console. Be careful not to damage the boot. This will separate the boot and inner trim ring from the console. Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip (2) which holds the shift knob (3) to the shift lever (1). Pull up on the shift knob to remove the knob and boot from the shift lever. Pull up on the rubber inner boot (6) to separate it from the shifter sound absorber (8). Remove the rubber vibration dampener from the shift lever. Remove the rubber inner boot from the shift lever. Go To Step 4. On 968s with plastic trim around the shifter boot perform the following (Refer to 968 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): Using a flat tip screwdriver gently pry around the base of the shifter boot next to the console. Be careful not to damage the boot. This will separate the boot and inner trim ring from the console. Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver. remove the spring clip (2) that holds the shifter knob (3) to the shift lever (1). Then pull up on the knob to remove it from the lever. Remove the four M6 cheesehead screws (9) that hold the shift lever bellows (6) to the top of the shifter sound absorber (8). Slide the bellows up and off of the shift lever. Go To Step 4. Disconnect the shifter rod (14, 16) from the shift lever as follows: On 944s, remove the &quot;C&quot; clip (16) from the groove on the shift lever pin. Be careful not to drop the clip. Then, slide the shifter rod off of the pin. Remove the washer (15) from the pin and set aside. On 968s, remove the spring clip (17) from the groove on the shift lever pin. Remove the washer (18) and bushing (19) from the shifter rod. You may have to slide the shifter rod off of the shift lever pin to remove the bushing. Remove the other bushing from the shifter rod and the remaining washers from shift lever pin. Inspect the shift lever pin for wear. If it is excessively worn, the pin will be tapered instead of the same diameter along it's entire length. If the pin shows excessive wear replace it. On 968 shift levers, it is more likely that the shift lever bushings (2) will be worn instead of the pin. Check the bushings by sliding them onto the shift lever pin and looking for excessive play. If the bushings show excessive wear replace them. Next remove the shift lever from the vehicle by removing the two bolts (13, 15) that hold the bearing bracket (9,11).    Lift the lever out of the sound absorber and inspect the plastic bearing. If it is cracked, broken, or the shifter comes out of the bearing easily, the bearing should be replaced. Installation If the plastic bearing is to be replaced, apply a small amount of Moly grease to the inside of the bearing and slide the new bearing into the bearing bracket. Push the shift lever ball into the bearing. It will be difficult to push into the bearing. That's normal. Use firm, steady pressure but, don't be overly aggressive as you can break the bearing. Install the shift lever into the sound absorber using the two retaining bolts (M8 x 12). Attach the shifter rod to the shift lever pin using the &quot;C&quot; clip (944s) or spring clip (968s). Check the shift lever alignment using the procedure in the following section. On 944s, install the rubber boot onto the shift lever and work the bottom of the boot onto the lip of the sound absorber opening. On 968s, install the bellows (6) onto the shift lever and attach it to the sound absorber using the four M6 x 16 screws. Install the shift lever knob and boot onto the shift lever using the spring clip. Attach the bottom of the boot to the console. Adjusting the Shift Lever There are two adjustments for the shift lever. One is for the inclination toward the front or rear of the car. The other is for the side-to-side inclination. In the factory shop manuals, this is referred to as lateral inclination or transverse inclination. Unfortunately, in the 968 Manuals, it refers to the side-to-side inclination as transverse inclination, and in the 944 Manual, it refers to it as lateral inclination. So, to avoid confusion, we simply won't use those terms. With the shift lever set to neutral, the shift lever should be inclined toward the rear of the car at an 85° angle. If the shift lever is not at the proper angle, loosen (but don't remove) the two bolts for the shifter bearing bracket and slide bracket forward or backward as necessary to obtain the correct angle on the shift lever. Then tighten the two bolts. Also, with the shift lever in neutral, the shift lever should be no side-to-side inclination. In other words, it should not be leaning to the left or right. If so, the side-to-side inclination must be adjusted at the transaxle. To adjust the side-to-side inclination on a 944, perform the following: Loosen the lock nut on the intermediate shaft linkage (see picture below). Move the intermediate shift lever to the left or right to change the inclination of the shift lever on the console. Moving the intermediate shift lever to the driver's side of the car will incline the shift lever on the console more toward the driver's side. Moving the intermediate shift lever to the passenger's side of the car will incline the shift lever on the console more toward the passenger's side. When the console shift lever is at the correct side-to-side inclination, tighten the intermediate shaft lock nut. To adjust the side-to-side inclination on a 968, perform the following: Loosen the locknuts (no. 1) on the intermediate shift lever adjustment turnbuckle and turn the center piece (no. 2) until there is no side-to-side inclination at the console shift lever (no. 3). When the shift lever is properly adjusted, tighten the turnbuckle locknuts. Checking the Transaxle Linkage for Wear The intermediate shift lever at the transaxle shift linkage is partially made of hard plastic (white part in the picture below). Over time the plastic can wear out causing the shifting to become sloppy. If you have already checked and/or replaced the shift lever and shift lever bearing or shift lever bushings (968 only) and there still seems to be some sloppiness to the shifting, inspect the intermediate shift lever for excessive play.

If you can not determine from the option code sticker on your car, or you believe the transaxle has been changed, then you'll have to get the code directly off of the transaxle. This is extremely difficult to do on a 944 transaxle since the code is stamped on top flange near the front of the transaxle. To be able to read the code, you'll need an inspection mirror and a flashlight. You may also need a rag to wipe the area clear of debris to be able to read the code. The drawing below is an example showing the location of the codes and how to translate the code. After you determine the code for your transaxle, you can use the table below to look up specific information about your transaxle. More transaxle information (924s and 968s) will be added as it becomes available.

The following is a list of problem symptoms discussed in this guide: Engine Will Not Rotate Engine Will Rotate But Will Not Start (Fire) Engine Is Difficult To Start When Cold Engine Is Difficult To Start When Hot Engine Idles Rough When Cold Engine Idle Surges Engine Shudders At Idle Engine Hesitates or Stumbles During Acceleration Engine Misses Engine Backfires Engine Oil Pressure Low Engine Oil Pressure High Engine Will Not Rotate. This situation is by far the easiest to troubleshoot as there are fewer possible causes than for an engine that will not fire. Engine Will Not Turn Over Possible Causes Refer To: Discharged or Faulty Battery ELECT-15 Battery Terminals Loose or Corroded ELECT-15 Bad Starter Motor or Starter Solenoid ELECT-16 Bad Ignition Switch ELECT-17 Broken or Loose Wiring In Starter Circuit ELECT-17 Broken Teeth on Starter Pinion or Flywheel 1 1Remove starter and inspect starter pinion teeth. Roll engine using a 24 mm (or 15/16&quot;) socket and ratchet and inspect flywheel for broken teeth. Engine Will Rotate But Not Will Not Start (Fire). When the engine will rotate but, will not start, it can typically be attributed to one of two causes: Lack of fuel Lack of spark This is where a fuel pressure gauge, a spark tester, and a digital multimeter are essential. For the most part, these two problems can be diagnosed independently of each other. However, there are several failures which will prevent the fuel pump from running and cause a no spark condition. Testing for Lack of Fuel As I mentioned before when testing for lack of fuel is is almost essential to have a fuel pressure gauge. You may test for fuel supply by removing the end cap from the fuel rail, installing a hose, and direct the open end of the hose to a catch pan. However, even if you get fuel from the rail during testing there is no guarantee that the fuel pressure is adequate to start the car. In lieu of a pressure test, fuel pump delivery rate test will at least give you an idea of the condition of the fuel pump. Procedure Connect a fuel pressure gauge to the end of the fuel rail. Attempt to start the vehicle while checking the fuel pressure gauge. If the fuel pressure rises on the gauge indicating the fuel pump has started, compare the maximum fuel pressure reading to the specifications in FUEL-01. If there is no increase in fuel pressure, and you suspect that that the fuel pump is not starting, refer to FUEL-16 for fuel pump troubleshooting. If your fuel pressure is low, or increases very slowly during cranking, refer to FUEL-16 for troubleshooting other fuel related problems. Testing For Lack of Spark The first step in testing for lack of spark is to verify that a no spark condition actually exists. A simple spark tester available at most auto parts stores is very handy here. I recommend removing the fuel pump fuse to keep the fuel pump from running during spark testing. Disconnect one of the plug wires and connect the spark tester in series with the spark plug. Crank the engine and look for spark. You'll see the spark pulsing inside the tester as the engine turns over. If there is no spark at the spark plug, disconnect the main lead from the ignition coil to the distributor cap and connect a spark tester in series with the coil wire. Crank the vehicle and check the tester for spark to the distributor. If you get good spark at the main lead to the distributor and no spark at the spark plug, the distributor cap and/or rotor is bad and should be replaced. If there is no spark at the distributor main lead, proceed with ignition troubleshooting using IGN-04, Ignition System Troubleshooting. Engine Is Difficult To Start When Cold. Possible Causes Checks Procedure DME Temperature Sensor Check Sensor Resistance. ELECT-19 Fuel System Vapor Lock Fuel System vapor lock can be caused by several things including a bad Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR), bad fuel pump check valve, or leaking injectors. Any of these three will cause the fuel rail pressure to drop rapidly after shutdown. When this happens the heat from the engine causes the fuel remaining in the fuel rail to flash to vapor. This causes voiding in the fuel rail. During subsequent startups, it make take a long time cranking the engine or may take several attempts to get the engine to fire. This is due to the fact that the fuel pump may take some time after starting to clear the void and refill the fuel rail. To determine if vapor lock is a potential cause, perform a fuel pressure and leakdown test (FUEL-01). If the fuel system fails the leakdown test, determine the cause of the leakdown using FUEL-17. FUEL-01 Fuel Pressure Too High Disconnect one fuel injector connector and attempt to start car. If the car starts and runs, where it would not before, then the Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR) is most likely bad and should be replaced. Bascially when the FPR fails causing the fuel rail pressure to go high, the injectors have too high a differential pressure across them, they draw too much current, and the injector driver shuts down. Disconnecting one injector wire reduces the injector current enough to allow the engine to start. Realize that the car will run very rough as it's running on three cylinders N/A Speed / Reference Sensors Sometimes a failing or misadjusted Speed and/or Reference sensor will cause difficult start. This is most common when the engine is hot. However, they can cause hard cold starting as well. Sometimes this may be simply to the wires or connectors. You may try wiggling the Speed and Reference sensor wires and connectors to see if the car will start. You should also try removing the sensors and cleaning the ends. Due to magnetic field buildup in the sensors they will pick up metal fines from the flywheel ring gear teeth and other sources which can interfere with signal development. Also, check the Speed and Reference sensor clearance. IGN-02 DME Computer Sometimes the DME computer will develop bad solder joints. Try tapping on the DME computer while attempting to start the car. If the car starts while tapping on the DME computer, where it would not before, the DME has some bad solder joints which should be repaired. Of course, if you tap on the DME computer and the car still doesn't start, it doesn't necessarily mean the DME is good or bad. If you eliminate all other problems, then it may be time to consider replacing the DME computer. As a minimum, I'd open up the DME computer and inspect it for bad solder joints. DME-05 Engine Is Difficult To Start When Hot. Possible Causes Checks Procedure DME/Fuel Pump Relay One of the first signs of a failing DME/Fuel Pump is difficult hot starting. Quite often when the DME/Fuel Pump relay starts failing the car will start without problems when it is cold. However, when the car has been operated at normal operating temperature for a while, it will refuse to start when the car is shut down and re-start is attempted while the car is still warm. After the car is allowed to sit and cool for some period of time (usually 30 minutes to 1 hour), the car will again start without problem. If you experience hot start problems, try making up and installing a jumper for the DME/Fuel Pump relay (FUEL-05 under &quot;Emergency Repairs&quot;) to see if it solves the hot start problem. Realize that you must attempt this while you are experiencing the hot start problem for the test to be valid. FUEL-05 Fuel System Vapor Lock Fuel System vapor lock can be caused by several things including a bad Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR), bad fuel pump check valve, or leaking injectors. Any of these three will cause the fuel rail pressure to drop rapidly after shutdown. When this happens the heat from the engine causes the fuel remaining in the fuel rail to flash to vapor.

N/A Engine Idles Rough When Cold. Possible Causes Checks Procedure DME Temperature Sensor On startup when the engine is cold, the DME temperature sensor tells the DME computer that the engine (coolant) is cold. This causes the DME computer to supply a much richer mixture to the engine (a hot engine atomizes fuel better). When the DME temperature starts to fail, it normally sends a higher than normal temperature signal to the DME computer. The DME computer in turn supplies a leaner mixture to the engine than that which is normally required. So, the engine runs rough (lean) and if it gets bad enough, may not run at all. Check the cold resistance of the DME temperature sensor ELECT-19 Vacuum Leak Inspect all hoses connecting to the intake manifold which are downstream of the AFM. N/A Engine Idle Surges. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Idle Stabilizer / Auxiliary Air Valve Clamp line from Idle Stabilizer / Auxiliary Air Valve to the intake manifold to see if idle stabilizes. If it does remove the Idle Stabilizer / Auxiliary Air Valve, clean it with Carburetor and Choke cleaner, reinstall and check operation. If the surging idle persists, replace the Idle Stabilizer / Auxiliary Air Valve. N/A Vacuum Leak Inspect all hoses connecting to the intake manifold which are downstream of the AFM. N/A Throttle Body Butterfly sticking Remove throttle body and clean area around butterfly valve. N/A Engine Shudders At Idle. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Engine Idle Set Too Low Check idle and reset if necessary. FUEL-08 Early US/Canada 944 DME Programming There was an inherent problem with the early 944 DME programming (pre-1985.5 US/Canadian models only). These cars had a momementary fuel cutoff when the throttle was released from any throttle position off idle. However, the tendency was for the idle to drop too low before the fuel cut back in resulting in an idle shudder. The problem seems to be more noticeable on some cars and on others does not appear at all. There are several ways to fix this problem. One is to replace the DME with the DME from a 1985.5 944. The other is to replace the DME computer with an ROW (Rest of the World) DME. And finally, you can adjust the throttle stop (loosen the throttle stop lock nut) until you hear the Throttle Position Switch click. Then tighten the lock nut. This eliminates the closed-throttle switch. Start the engine and adjust the idle adjustment screw to bring the idle back down but, leave it a little high (around 1000 RPM). There is also a software fix which was developed by FR Wilk ( http://frwilk.com/early944/misc/shudder.htm. However, it's typically beyond the capabilities of most shade tree mechanics. N/A Engine Hesitates or Stumbles During Acceleration. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Dead spot in Air Flow Sensor / Air Flow Meter (AFM) potentiometer. Test AFM. ELECT-19 Vacuum Leak. With a large vacuum leak, the car may idle correctly. However, as soon as you open the throttle, the car may hesitate, stumble, or even cutoff. The best way to look for vacuum leaks is to connect a source of compressed air (approximately 10 psi will do it) to the intake manifold with the engine not running and listen for air leaks. N/A Spark Plugs Fouled. Remove spark plugs and check condition. ENG-18 Engine Misses. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Bad spark plug wires. Run the engine in a dark area and look for arcing from the spark plug wires to the engine. N/A Cracked distributor cap. Remove cap and check condition. N/A Faulty spark plug. Remove spark plugs individually and inspect for broken or excessively worn electrode or cracked insulator. Check the condition of the spark plugs by color. ENG-18 Vacuum leak. Check for vacuum leaks by pressuizing the intake manifold with compressed air. Listen for leaks. N/A Clogged fuel filter. Replace filter. FUEL-03 DME Computer A faulty DME computer can cause a variety of starting and running problems. Normally, problems with the DME computer are the result of bad solder joints which can frequently be repaired. There's really no way to test the DME unless you can swap it into another vehicle or unless you can borrow a known good DME to install for testing purposes. And, even a good used DME computer is a little pricey. So, I don't like to run out and replace the DME unless I've eliminated all other possible causes. If you suspect the DME computer is bad, as a minimum, I would open it up and inspect for bad solder joints (and repair them) before replacing the computer. DME-05 Engine Backfires. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Fautly ignition system. If you have one cylinder that is not firing completely or is firing intermitently, raw fuel can be expelled into a hot exhaust system where it is subequently ignited. Check for faulty spark plugs wires and/or faulty spark plug. N/A Vacuum leak. Check for vacuum leaks by pressuizing the intake manifold with compressed air. Listen for leaks. N/A DME Computer A faulty DME computer can cause a variety of starting and running problems. Normally, problems with the DME computer are the result of bad solder joints which can frequently be repaired. There's really no way to test the DME unless you can swap it into another vehicle or unless you can borrow a known good DME to install for testing purposes.

If you suspect the DME computer is bad, as a minimum, I would open it up and inspect for bad solder joints (and repair them) before replacing the computer. DME-05 Engine Oil Pressure Low. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Oil Level Low Check oil level and top off if necessary. On 1987 and newer 944s, check for low oil level light lit. LUBE-03 Crankshaft pulley bolt loose. Check torque on crankshaft pulley bolt (155 ft-lbs). LUBE-03 Bad oil pressure sending unit. Check sending unit. LUBE-03 ELECT-19 Oil pump lost prime. This is not uncommon with cars that have been sitting around for a while without being run. To prime the oil pump, remove the oil filter, and pour oil down the center hole of the oil filter housing while turning the crankshaft in the counter-clockwise direction. Install the oil filter (preferably a new one) when done and crank the engine to check for oil pressure. LUBE-03 Bad or stuck open oil pressure relief valve. There's really no way to check the oil pressure relief valve operation. About the only thing you can do is remove the relief valve, clean it, and reinstall it making sure it does not bind as you install it in the housing. N/A Worn engine bearings. If engine oil pressure indications are fairly normal exept that the oil pressure indicates low when the engine is fully warmed up, the cause could be worn main and/or rod bearings. For normal bearing pressure indications take a look at LUBE-03. LUBE-03 Broken oil pump pickup tube. This is not a very common occurance and there's no way to check for it without removing the oil pan. Removing the pan to check the pickup tube is a last resort if all other attempts to restore oil pressure have failed. N/A Bad oil pump The oil pumps on these cars are generally bullet proof. When they go bad, it's generally the result of losing prime to the oil pump which can destroy not only the pump but, the main and rod bearings as well. Again, this is one of those things that you can't really test for. All you can really do is remove the pump, disassemble it, and inspect the pump gears. N/A Engine Oil Pressure High. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Bad oil pressure sending unit A bad sending unit is normally the cause for a high oil pressure indication. For symptoms of a bad sending unit and troubleshooting, check LUBE-03 and ELECT-19. LUBE-03 ELECT-19 Stuck closed oil pressure relief valve. Not a very common problem. There's really no way to check the oil pressure relief valve operation. About the only thing you can do is remove the relief valve, clean it, and reinstall it making sure it does not bind as you install it in the housing. N/A Blocked oil passage. About the only time I've seen this happen is when the check valve for the oil supply to the cylinder head sticks closed. When this happens, it will be accompanied by loud tapping noise from the hydraulic lifters. If the oil passage into the camshaft housing itself becomes blocked you'll typically see an oil leak at the cam assembly to cylinder head gasket. N/A Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[180]=new Array("shop-manual/ts-02.htm","Troubleshooting - Cooling System","","TS-02, Troubleshooting - Cooling System Introduction This troubleshooting guide is intented to help identify and repair problems with the cooling system. The following is a list of problem symptoms discussed in this guide: Overheating Overcooling Loss of Coolant Improper Cooling Fan Operation Engine overheats. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Improper coolant level Check coolant level and fill if necessary. N/A Cooling fans, thermofan switch, or fan relay not operating correctly. Check cooling fan operation using COOL-01. COOL-01 Air in cooling system. Fill and vent cooling system using COOL-02. COOL-02 Head gasket. A leaking head gasket can allow cylinder gasses to pressurize the cooling system. This will void the area around the cooling jackets, overpressurize the cooling system, and cause the reservior cap to relieve coolant which result in overheating. This may appear to be a coolant leak at first. This can often be identified by a compression test or cylinder leakdown test. Another method of identifying this leak is to take the car to a radiator shop and have them test the coolant for the presence of exhaust gasses. N/A Faulty thermostat. Remove and test the thermostat using COOL-08. COOL-08 Wrong Thermostat. When Porsche changed the water pump on later 944s, the depth of the snap ring groove from the thermostat sealing surface changed. This required the use of a different thermostat and thermostat sealing ring. If you get the wrong thermostat it can cause cooling problems. This is described in COOL-07. COOL-07 Bad water pump. This is a somewhat unusual problem and difficult to identify. Apparently, with some rebuilt water pumps, the pulley will sometime slip on the water pump shaft. This is particularly true with a fresh rebuild where the water pump seal is a bit tight. To check for this problem, remove the top timing cover and locate the water pump pulley. When you look at the pulley you'll see the end of the water pump shaft in the center of the pulley. Using a paint pen, permanent marker, or brightly colored finger nail polish, place a mark across the end of the pump shaft and pulley. When you start the engine, if the pulley is slipping the mark on the shaft and the mark on the pulley will NOT remain aligned. If you discover that the pulley is slipping it is possible to correct this by placing a tack weld on the end of the water pump shaft where it meets the pulley. Make sure you put a tack weld on opposing sides of the shaft where it meets the pulley so the pump will remain balanced. N/A Faulty coolant reservoir cap. If the coolant reservoir cap does not hold it's correct pressure, the coolant in the cooling system can boil causing voids in the system and overheating. Remove the cap and check that it opens at the pressure stamped on the cap (normally in millibars) and not significantly below it. You may have to convert the millibars stamped on the cap to PSI depending on your location. If you can't borrow a coolant pressure tester, take the cap to a radiator shop or major auto parts store and have them test it for you. N/A Radiator internal passages blocked or excess debris on outside of radiator. Remove the radiator using COOL-04. Take it to a professional radiator shop and have it tested and if necessary cleaned. COOL-04 Engine Overcools. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Faulty thermostat. Remove and test the thermostat using COOL-08. COOL-08 Engine Loses Coolant. Possible Causes Checks Procedure External Leak Leaks external to the engine seem like they would be very easy to locate. However, leaks will often not appear until the coolant system is fully pressurized. Since that only happens when the engine is run to normal operating temperature, the heat generated in the engine compartment can make it difficult to look for leaks. If you can borrow or rent a coolant pressure tester to pressurize the system while it is cold, it makes it much simpler to look for leaks. Possible Leak Locations: Coolant hoses (i.e. radiator, heater control valve, return from heater core at back of engine compartment) Water Pump (may require removing upper timing cover) N/A Internal Leak Generally and internal leak can result in coolant leaking into the cylinders or into the oil system at an oil-water interface. Possible Leak Locations: Head Gasket Oil Cooler Seals Cracked Cylinder Wall Generally, internal leaks are primarily the head gasket leaking allowing coolant to enter the cylinder. These can be identified by large amounts of white smoke coming from the exhaust. Also, you can remove the spark plugs one at a time and look for a &quot;wet&quot; spark plug that smells like anti-freeze. Head gasket leaks can also be identified by performing a compression test or cylinder leakdown test. Cracked cylinder wall leaks will cause the same symptoms but, are extremely rare. Leaks that allow coolant to enter the oil system are somewhat unusual because the oil system normally operates at a much higher pressure than the coolant system. So, head gasket or oil cooler leaks typically first appear as oil in the coolant (milk shake) as opposed to coolant in the oil. Normally, the only time you see coolant in the oil first is when there is a sudden catastrophic head gasket or seal failure immediately after engine shutdown. N/A Cooling Fans Do Not Operate Correctly. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Cooling Fans Cooling fan operation and troubleshooting is covered in detail in COOL-01. COOL-01 Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[181]=new Array("shop-manual/ts-03.htm","Troubleshooting - Fuel System","","TS-03, Troubleshooting - Fuel System Introduction This troubleshooting guide is intented to help identify and repair Fuel System problems. The following is a list of problem symptoms discussed in this guide: Excessive Fuel Consumption Strong Fuel Smell In Passenger's Compartment Excessive Fuel Consumption Possible Causes Checks Procedure Dirty Air Filter Check / Change Air Filter N/A Bad O2 Sensor (if equipped). Check sensor and replace if necessary. FUEL-18 Poor Ignition System Function Check the condition of the distributor cap and rotor. Check the condition of the spark plugs and spark plug wires. IGN-04 Strong Fuel Smell In Passenger's Compartment Possible Causes Checks Procedure Fuel Level Sender Gasket Using ELECT-13, locate the fuel level sender and check the condition of the gasket around the sender cap (1985.5 and newer). If it appears hard/brittle, remove the sender and replace the gasket. The part number for the gasket is 944-201-327-00. Early 944s aren't as susceptable to this problem as they use an o-ring seal between the sender and the top of the gas tank. The sender is held in place by 5 cheesehead screws each with it's own seal ring. You can get fuel smell from the early cars as well if any of these seals go bad. The part number for the sender o-ring is 477-919-133. The seal rings for the cheesehead screws are part number M 013 802 1. ELECT-13 Fuel Tank Ventilation System The fuel tank has a ventilation system which is designed to prevent pressure buildup in the tank by removing fuel vapor. The system has hoses that run from the tank along the bottom of the vehicle on the right hand side, into the engine compartment, along the back of the firewall, to a charcoal filter canister in the left fender well (must remove the interior fender well cover to locate canister). If any of those fuel lines is loose, cut, or leaking, you will get a strong fuel smell inside the passenger's compartment. Also, if the charcoal cannister itself is split or otherwise leaking you'll get a raw fuel smell in the passenger's compartment. N/A Fuel Filler or Fuel Reservoir System Leak There are a number of rubber hoses and rubber sleeves associated with the fuel filler and fuel reservoir system which can cause a fuel smell in the passenger's compartment if they develop holes or if their hose clamps come loose. The filler system and reservoir components are located in the rear hatch area behind the carpet on the fuel filler side of the car and behind the paneling on the inside of the roof pillar on that same side. See the diagrams below for exploded views of the system. Early Fuel Filler and Reservoir (Pre-1985.5) Late Fuel Filler and Reservoir One specific problem related to the fuel filler/reservoir system is the fuel system ventilation valves. When these valves stick, it can result in fuel vapors leaking into the passenger's compartment. If you get a noticeable &quot;whooshing&quot; sound (sorry for the use of the non-technical teminology) when you remove the fuel filler cap, there's a good chance that the ventilation valve is stuck and is causing your fuel smell. For the early fuel system, there are two valves. There is a shut off valve (#19 in the Early Fuel Diagram) and a ventilation valve (#20). The part number for the shut off valve is 928 201 083 02. The part number for the ventilation valve is 810 201 186 A. The late fuel system only uses one valve (#17 in the Late Fuel Diagram) which is the same shut off valve used on the early cars (928 201 083 02). Another specific problem is a leaking fuel cap gasket. For the early cars the gasket (#30 in the Early Fuel Diagram) is part number 477 201 553. For the late cars, the gasket (#5 in the Late Fuel Diagram) is part number 944 201 553 00. I suspect it's the same part for both and Porsche just changed to a Porsche specific part number later on. Apparently another problem which can result in the fuel cap not sealing properly is elongation of the fuel filler neck (#12 in Early Fuel Digram, #7 Late). Over time, as the fuel system is repeatedly filled, the weight of the fuel nozzle hanging in the fuel filler neck can cause the neck to distort in shape. When this happens the fuel cap will not properly seal and you'll get fumes into the passenger's compartment. The fuel filler neck is a sleeve which is replaceable. The part number for early cars with chassis code up to 94EN4 00060 is 931 201 281 01. For all other 944s is 931 201 281 02. N/A Clark's Garage © 1998");sQ1[182]=new Array("shop-manual/ts-04.htm","Troubleshooting - Clutch","","TS-04, Troubleshooting - Clutch Introduction This troubleshooting guide is intented to help identify and repair problems with the clutch system. The following is a list of problem symptoms discussed in this guide: Clutch pedal travels to floor with little or no resistance Clutch pedal feel soft when depressed Unable to engage transmission into gear Clutch slips Clutch grabs or shudders as it is engaged Noise or vibration coming from the area of the clutch 944 CLUTCH HYDRAULIC SYSTEM 944 CLUTCH CONTROLS Clutch pedal travels to floor with little or no resistance Possible Causes Checks Procedure Clutch master cylinder or slave cylinder is bad. The master or slave cylinder can fail due to an internal or external seal leak. The most common seems to be external seal leakage. Inspect the clutch master cylinder and slave cylinder for leakage and rebuild or replace if leaking. One check you can perform on the master cylinder is to depress the clutch pedal while someone watches the brake fluid reservoir level. If the level rises while the clutch pedal is being depressed, The clutch master cylinder is bad and should be rebuilt or replaced. CLUTCH-04 CLUTCH-02 Leaking hose or fitting. Check the condition of the hose from the brake fluid reservoir to the clutch master cylinder (leakage). Check for leakage from the fittings at the clutch master cylinder and the line from the clutch master cylinder down to the slave cylinder. N/A Fluid in brake reservoir has dropped below the level of the hose going to the clutch master cylinder. Fill the brake fluid reservoir and bleed clutch if it feels spongy after filling. CLUTCH-02 Broken clutch relese lever Difficult to check but may be able to check by looking at the end of the relese lever in the round opening in the clutch housing. Try pushing on the end of the lever with a screwdriver. If it moves easily the release lever may be broken requiring replacement. N/A Clutch pedal feel soft when depressed Possible Causes Checks Procedure Air in the system. Normally a soft or spongy feel to the clutch when the pedal is depressed is the result of air in the system. Frequently this is caused by the brake fluid reservoir dropping below the level of the hose which goes from the brake reservoir to the clutch master cylinder. So, check the brake fluid level and fill if necessary. Then bleed the clutch using CLUTCH-02. CLUTCH-02 Unable to engage transmission into gear Possible Causes Checks Procedure Bad clutch disc There's not really any way to determine positively that the clutch disc is bad. However, if you can not engage the transmission into any gear with the engine running but, can engage it into gear with the engine shutdown., that's a good sign that either the clutch disc or pressure plate is bad. You can get some indication of the condition of the clutch by performing a clutch disc wear check (CLUTCH-03). Replace clutch (CLUTCH-01). CLUTCH-03 CLUTCH-01 Bad pressure plate Like the clutch disc, there's not really any way to determine positively that the pressure plate is bad. Again, if you can not engage the transmission into any gear with the engine running but, can engage it into gear with the engine shutdown., that's a good sign that either the clutch disc or pressure plate is bad. Replace clutch (CLUTCH-01). CLUTCH-01 Transmission or shift linkage bad Refer to TS-05, Troubleshooting - Manual Transmission TS-05 Clutch slips Possible Causes Checks Procedure Bad clutch disc The clutch disc can be worn or if the clutch disc is contaminated it will slip. The clutch disc can become contaminated by oil if you have a rear main oil seal leak. It can become contaminated by coolant if you have a leaking coolant hose at the back of the engine compartment. Check for oil and coolant leaks around the back of the engine. Look for signs of oil or coolant coming out of the bottom of the clutch housing. Check clutch disc wear using CLUTCH-03. Replace clutch disc if there are signs of contamination or if the wear check is bad (CLUTCH-01). CLUTCH-03 CLUTCH-01 Pressure plate or flywheel warped. If the flywheel or pressure plate are warped, the pressure plate will not have enough clamping force to keep the clutch disc pressed against the flywheel. There's really now way to check for this without disassembling the clutch and inspecting the flywheel and pressure plate. CLUTCH-01 Clutch disc overheated. During heavy clutch usage (i.e. at the track), the clutch disc can become overheated causing it to slip. If you think that may be the case, allow it to cool for an hour or so and the clutch will likely stop slipping. N/A Clutch grabs or shudders as it is engaged Possible Causes Checks Procedure Clutch disc contaminated A contaminated clutch disc can cause the clutch to grab, shudder, or even slip. Check for oil and coolant leaks around the back of the engine. Look for signs of oil or coolant coming out of the bottom of the clutch housing. Replace clutch disc if there are signs of contamination (CLUTCH-01). CLUTCH-01 Driver induced shudder. Sometimes the way a car is driven can cause the clutch to be grabby or induce the shudder. There are basically two different types of drivers with regards to clutch operation. Those who feather the clutch and those who jab the clutch. Those who jab the clutch get on and off the clutch pedal very quickly when changing gears. Over time, this will tend the make the clutch grabby. Someone who feathers the clutch engages and disengages the clutch slowly. So, if you're one who normally feathers the clutch and you get in a car that's normally driven by someone who jabs the clutch, you'll likely notice a shudder when you engage the clutch. The advantage to gettting on and off the clutch quickly is that it normally extends the life of the clutch by reducing the amount of wear. N/A Warped pressure plate or flywheel. Again, there's really no way to check for this without disassembling the clutch and inspecting the pressure plate and flywheel. CLUTCH-01 Worn splines on clutch disc. There's really no way to check for this without disassembling the clutch and inspecting the clutch disc. CLUTCH-01 Noise or vibration coming from the area of the clutch Possible Causes Checks Procedure Bad release bearing or pilot bearing Excessive noise from the clutch area can be caused by a bad release bearing or pilot bearing. The clutch assembly must be disassembled to replace the bearings. CLUTCH-01 Pressure plate bad.. A broken sping in the pressure plate can cause excessive noise and vibration. Replace clutch. CLUTCH-01 Clutch disc bad. A broken spring in the clutch disc or a bad rubber centered clutch diaphragm can cause excessive vibration and noise. Only normally-aspirated 944s were equipped with the rubber centered clutch disc. Most people now days replace the rubber centered disc with the spring centered clutch discs when the clutch requires replacing.

Noise from drive train with engine idling, clutch pedal not depressed, and transmission in neutral. Noise from drive train during normal driving. Transmission difficult to shift or will not engage into gear. Rattle from the rear of the car at low RPM. Possible Causes Checks Procedure 5th Gear This is a fairly normal problem, one that Porsche is aware of, and refused warranty claims on. Apparently, 5th gear has more clearance, and hence more play on the transaxle mainshaft than the other gears and tends to rattle at low RPM. The type of transaxle fluid used affects the amount of noise. A good synthetic gear oil will reduce the noise and in some cases eliminate it completely. N/A Noise from drive train with engine idling and clutch pedal depressed. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Clutch release bearing or pilot bearing Usually a high pitched squealing or grating noise. There's really no way to identify this problem positively without disassembling the clutch. Use the Clutch Replacement procedure to disassemble and inspect but, exhaust all other possible causes first as this is a tedious procedure. CLUTCH-01 Noise from drive train with engine idling, clutch pedal not depressed, and transmission in neutral. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Clutch Disc If the car is equipped with a rubber centerd clutch, the rubber eventually rots and disintegrates causing noise (usually a thumping noise) which is transmitted along the drive line.

CLUTCH-01 Torque tube bearings Usually a high pitched squealing noise or grating noise. Try using a mechanics stethoscope to pinpoint the location of the noise. If you determine that it is most likely the torque tube bearings, replace the torque tube or rebuild using the Torque Tube Revoval, Rebuild, and Installation procedure. TRANS-05 Drive Shaft to Transaxle Input Shaft Coupling This is not a very common problem but, I have heard of at least one instance where the bolts that secure the coupling came loose and the coupling started rattling. This occurred shortly after a clutch replacement (which requires removal of the transaxle). So, the coupling bolts were not properly torqued during the coupling installation. N/A Transaxle While noise in the drive train under the condition specified can come from the transaxle it is not common. Normally, transaxle noise in this condition comes from one of the input shaft bearings. The only permenant fix is to rebuild the transaxle. N/A Noise from drive train during normal driving. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Before you start trying to troubleshoot this problem, you should try to eliminate as many potential causes of drive line noise as possible. So, you should first allow the car to idle with clutch engaged (clutch pedal not depressed) and the transaxle in neutral. If the noise is NOT present in this condition, it eliminates the clutch disc, clutch release and pilot bearings, torque tube bearings, and transaxle input shaft coupling as possible causes of the noise. CV Joints Frequently, noise from the rear end is caused by the CV Joints. And, it's most common for this to be due to lack of lubrication. You'd think that the grease in the CV Joints would not disappear unless the CV Joint Boot is bad. However, it happens. Anytime you have a noise that you narrowed down to the rear end of the drive train, your first action should be to rebuild/repack the CV Joints using the CV Joint General Information, Removal, Installation, and Maintenance procedure. SUSP-01 Rear Wheel Bearings The next most common cause of rear drive line noise is bad wheel bearings. If the noise changes pitch, disappears during cornering, or only appears during cornering, the most likely cause is the wheel bearings. The wheel bearings should be replaced using Rear Wheel Bearing Replacement - Steel Trailing Arms or Rear Wheel Bearing Replacement - Aluminum Trailing Arms. SUSP-09 SUSP-11 Transaxle If you have eliminated the CV Joints and Rear Wheel Bearings as possible causes of the rear drive line noise, it's time to turn to the transaxle. There are approximately 10 bearings in the transaxle including the front and rear needle bearings, the individual gear needle bearings, the four point ball bearing in the transmission case, and the tapered roller bearings for the two flange shafts. Any one or more of these bearings going bad can cause can cause noise from the transaxle. The only bearings that are replaceable without a great deal of disassembly are the axle flange shaft roller bearings. However, I don't have a procedure for that yet. As far as rebuilding the transaxle, it requires a number of special tools to press component onto and off of the transaxle shafts and to set pre-loads. So, a complete rebuild is best left to a professional transmission shop. N/A Transmission difficult to shift or will not engage into gear. Possible Causes Checks Procedure Clutch Disc Refer to TS-04, Troubleshooting - Clutch TS-04 Pressure Plate Refer to TS-04, Troubleshooting - Clutch TS-04 Transaxle Bad sychros in the transaxle will cause difficult shifting. 944s are notorious for 2nd gear and sometimes 3rd gear sychros to go bad. If the transmission is difficult to shift when cold, particularly in second gear, and the shifting improves as the transaxle warms up, it's due to a bad synchro. The only permanent solution is to rebuild the transaxle. However, switching to a synthetic gear oil in the transaxle will most likely improve the shifting. N/A Shift Lever or Shift Linkage A worn and sloppy shift lever or shift linkage can make shifting difficult. Inspect the shift lever and shift linkage and make repairs as necessary.

Brake dust which gets between the back of the brake pad and the caliper piston can cause vibration (squealing) during driving. When the brake pedal is depressed, the piston presses against the brake pad and stops the vibration (and the squealing). There are a number of methods which can be utilized to stop vibration: Anti-Squeal Pads. Most brakes pad sets now days come with anti-squeal pad. However, if yours do not have them, they can usually be obtained at most auto parts stores. Brake Pad Grease. Applying brake pad grease to the back of the brake pad can stop vibration. The grease is sold in packets at most auto parts stores. However, bearing grease works just as well. Adhesive. When other methods don't seem to work, I have stopped brake squeal by applying some adhesive to the back of the brake pad. This adheres the pad to the caliper piston and will normally stop the vibration. A number of adhesives will work but, I normally use 3M Vinyl and Trim Adhesive. Brake Pads.

However, it is very tedious because there are a lot of components that must be removed to get to the turbocharger. This procedure will provide you with the instructions necessary to remove and install the turbocharger. If you are installing a turbocharger other than a factory replacement (K26-6 or K26-8) there are some things which you should know. First, if the new turbocharger has a larger diameter compressor inlet than the factory unit (i.e. K27), the stock rubber inlet plenum boot will have to be modified and some type of adapter will be needed to connect it to the new turbocharger. Second, if the new turbocharger has a larger compressor housing than the factory unit (i.e. K27), the cooling water outlet line (hard pipe), will have to be reshaped (bent), to clear the housing of the new turbocharger. This may also cause the temperature sensor to come in contact with the bottom of the intake manifold in which case a low profile detector will be required. Lastly, you should ensure that the turbocharger you buy is a good match for your current setup. It may require a new set of chips for the DME and KLR to take full advantage of the new turbo's capability. All the things I've mentioned above are things your turbocharger supplier SHOULD tell you. However, when I purchased my K-27 a number of years ago, my supplier didn't even know that the things I mentioned above were problems. Below is a series of questions you should ask your supplier before purchasing any turbocharger. Turbocharger Questions How do I know if this turbocharger is a good match for my current setup? Are there any modifications or fabrication required to install the turbocharger? Do I need a new set of chips to use this turbocharger or to get the best performance from this turbo? If so, where can I get the chips? Is there any additional equipment I need to get the best performance out of the turbocharger?

Disconnect the two hoses on either side of the intercooler discharge pipe and remove the pipe from the car. Remove the rubber inlet plenum boot from the turbocharger inlet. Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. Using FUEL-09, remove the intake manifold. Remove the belly pan. Using COOL-02, drain the coolant system. Remove the alternator air supply flexible hose. Remove the turbocharger cooling pump as follows: Disconnect the turbocharger cooling pump electrical connector (located along the shock tower near the cooling pump. Loosen the 10 mm nut at the strut tower which holds the upper cooling pump bracket and a hold down strap for the air conditioning lines. On the back side of the master cylinder heat shield that holds the bottom of cooling pump bracket in place. Using a 10 mm wrench loosen the bolt. You'll need to remove the bolt by turning it with your fingers to keep from dropping it. If you have a magnet, have it handy in case you lose your grip on the bolt. Slide the bracket off the top stud. Disconnect the coolant hoses from the cooling pump and remove it from the car. (Optional) Remove the master cylinder heat shield. The turbo can be removed and installed without removing the heat shield. However, it is a much simpler job if you take a little extra time to remove the heat shield. Loosen the heat shield between the turbocharger and the engine block. This will allow you enough remove to loosen and remove the banjo bolt (19 mm) for the turbocharger oil supply line. Be careful not to drop the banjo bolt seal rings when removing the banjo bolt. Remove the two bolts (15 mm) attaching the other end of the oil supply Disconnect the supply and return cooling lines from the turbocharger. Disconnect the flange for the turbocharger supply from the exhaust system. Under the car, remove the heat shield for the steering shaft universal joint. Loosen the four bolts that mount the steering rack to the front cross-member. This will allow you to lower the power steering rack slightly to provide access to the lower turbocharger mounting bolt. Remove the bolts from the triangle flange on the turbocharger outlet pipe (above the O2 sensor). Also remove the M8 bolt that attaches the flange to the engine block. On the underside of the motor mount bracket, you'll find the two Allen head bolts that hold the turbocharger to the motor mount bracket. Using a stubby 6 mm socket, short 6 mm hex key, or 6 mm ball head hex socket, remove the two Allen head bolts. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you &quot;wake up&quot; the Allen head bolts ( BOLT-01)before you attempt to remove them. If you do not, there is a very good chance that you'll strip the heads on the bolts. You may also find it necessary to disconnect the motor mount bolt and jack the engine up on that side to get enough clearance for proper engagement of the hex head tool into the head of the Allen bolt. You should now be able to lift the turbocharger out of the car. Remember a short length of the outlet pipe will remain attached to the turbo when it comes out of the car. Installation Install the turbocharger exhaust side outlet pipe on the turbo. Make sure you replace the flange seal ring. Place a new o-ring in the groove on top of the motor mount (turbo oil outlet seal). Install a new seal ring in the groove on the turbocharger hot side inlet flange. A small amount of bearing grease applied to the ring will hold it in place while installing the turbocharger. Carefully set the turbocharger in place on top of the motor mount. Be careful not to move the turbo around too much while setting it in place. It is possible to move the o-ring out of the groove and subsequently crush or cut the o-ring when tightening the mounting bolts. Install the two turbocharger mounting bolts from the bottom of the motor mount bracket. Install the heat shield for the steering universal joint. Install and tighten the turbocharger inlet flange bolts. Install the turbocharger oil supply line. Be sure to install a new o-ring at the turbocharger flange and new seal rings for the banjo bolt at the balance shaft housing. Install the mounting bolts for the balance shaft housing heat shield. Install and tighten the mounting bolt which attaches the turbocharger down pipe triangle flange to the block. Install the cooling water supply line and turbocharger cooling pump.

Unfortunately, if you buy a 951 that's already been modified, unless there's a record of the upgrade, you may not know which turbo you actually have. Peter, a Rennlist member, has come up with a way to identify the difference between the K26-6 and the K26-8. He has graciously allowed me to share that information here in the Garage Shop Manual. Turbo Identification The basic difference between the two turbos is that the K26-6 has approximately a 1&quot; square flat spot on the turbine housing which the K26-8 does not (picture below). With the turbocharger in the car, you can shine a flashlight down alongside and just in front of the engine oil dipstick. Then if you look at a 45-degree angle from the front towards the bottom of the dipstick, you should be able to clearly identify if the turbocharger has the 1&quot; flat square. If it has the square, it's a K26-6. No square, it's a K26-8 (see picture of a K26-6 below).

In other words, you will car will not achieve full boost from the turbocharger system. If so, you should first perform a simple test to determine if the source of the problem is with the electronic portion of the boost control system or if the problem is mechanical. Perform the Low Boost Pressure Test which follows. Low Boost Pressure Test Clamp the actuating line to the wastegate using a hose clamp. Test drive the vehicle and determine the available boost pressure. CAUTION! Use extreme caution when driving the car with the actuating line clamped off. The overboost protection system is defeated by clamping the line. If the charging system is intact, you can overboost the engine and cause extensive damage. If the boost pressure achieved is 1.75 bar as indicated on the car's boost gauge, the mechanical portion of the charging system is working properly. This includes the wastegate, turbocharger, air intake system, and turbo bypass valve. If the minimum boost pressure is not achieved, proceed with testing the individual mechanical components. Wastegate Testing Wastegate testing must be done with the exhaust system initially cold. Raise the vehicle on jack stand. Disconnect the wastegate actuating line for the wastegate and connect a pressure pump. Start the engine an allow it to idle. The exhaust line to the wastegate should heat up after a short period of time. However, if the wastegate is closed and not leaking by, the bypass line out of the wastegate will be cold. Using the pressure pump slowly apply pressure to the wastegate while feeling the bypass line. NOTE Never apply more that approximately 14.5 psi (1 bar) pressure to the wastegate diaphragm during testing. The factory shop manual says to apply 0.6 bar (8.7 psi) of pressure to the wastegate to get it to open. However, the pressures listed below are based on actual numbers from two different 944 Turbo owners who independently tested their wastegates and came up with the same results. At a pressure of approximately 4 psi (0.2 bar), the wastegate should start to open as indicated by a temperature increase in the wastegate bypass line. At a pressure of approximately 7 psi (4.8 bar) the wastegate should be fully open. Of course, you won't be able to see the exact position of the wastegate if you are testing it in place. However, you can check actual position of the valve during a bench test. When the pressure is suddenly removed, the wastegate should close as indicated by an audible click.

To prepare for that, I remove the wastegate from the car, removed the diaphragm from the valve body, and traced around the bottom flange of the diaphragm onto a piece of paper to make a template for further shim fabrication. Some months after I got the car back on the road, I realized that my wastegate would only hold about 17.5 psi boost. After talking to several 951 owners who were getting over 20 psi out the factory wastegate, I figured my spring must be a little weak and it was time I shimmed the wastegate. For those who are unfamiliar with what shimming consists of, it is basically installing washers or gaskets between the wastegate diaphragm and wastegate valve body. The increases the pre-load on the wastegate spring and subsequently the maximum boost pressure the wastegate will hold. Fabricating Shims Shims may be fabricated by making a drawing based on the Shim Template and transferring it to a piece of sheet metal. Alternatively, the wastegate can be disassembled and a template made by tracing the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm onto a piece of paper for instruction on disassembling the wastegate refer to the Shim Installation section.

Remove the three Allen head bolts that hole the wastegate diaphragm to the wastegate body (6 mm). NOTE Two of the Allen head bolts hold the wastegate mounting bracket to the wastegate. Mark the orientation of the bracket on the wastegate body prior to remove the bolts. Remove the wastegate valve. The valve has an Allen head insert in the bottom (8 mm). Separate the wastegate diaphragm from the valve body and insert two shims between the valve body and the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm. Insert the Allen head retaining bolts. If the wastegate was removed with the mounting bracket left in the car only install the retaining bolt which threads into the nut which is tack welded onto the diaphragm flange. Before torquing the bolt (20 Nm (14 ft-lbs)), ensure the remaining two bolt holes in the shims are lined up with the holes in the wastegate body and diaphragm.

There are a number of different ways to approach getting the wastegate out but, none are simple. So, what I'll try to do here is explain just how the wastegate is mounted and how I approached getting it out. I'm certainly not claiming that my way is the best so, study the mounting arrangement and decide for yourself which way you think is easiest. Wastegate Mounting Arrangement The wastegate diaphragm is attached to the wastegate valve body by three Allen head bolts (6 mm hex). The bolts go up through the valve body and then through the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm. One of the bolts threads into a nut that is tack welded to the diaphragm flange. However, the other two bolt go through the diaphragm flange and thread into bolts that are tack welded to the wastegate mounting bracket. The other end of the mounting bracket is bolted to another bracket that is bolted around the torque tube (two bolts - 13 mm head). The wastegate discharge pipe has a flange that is bolted to the valve body with four bolts (13 mm head) and to the bracket on the torque tube by a single bolt (13 mm head). The other end of the discharge pipe is attached to the rest of the exhaust system by a flange just prior to entering the main exhaust pipe (2 bolts - 10 mm). The wastegate inlet pipe has a flange which is mounted on four studs on the valve body on the other end (just off the cross-over pipe) the inlet pipe is attach by a triangle flange (3 bolts - 10 mm). Now let's list all the problems that make this job difficult: On both flanged connections (inlet and outlet pipe), the pipe is inserted into the flange by at least an inch or two. So, even if you unbolt the wastegate from the torque tube mounting bracket, you still have to remove one of the pipes (inlet or outlet) to get the assembly out of the car. Removing the inlet pipe with the assembly in the car appears to be impossible unless you remove the studs at the inlet flange. Because of the tight working conditions, I didn't consider this an option. Removing the discharge pipe seems much easier at first glance until you realize that the heads on the mounting bolts are too close to the flange to get a STANDARD socket on them (hold that thought). Again, with the discharge pipe inserted into the flange several inches, moving the discharge pipe around enough once it is unbolted is difficult. The wastegate mounting bolts (at the torque tube) are extremely difficult to get to. Removing the Wastegate Tools Modified 13 mm socket (description of modification included later) Ratchet Universal joint for socket 6&quot; socket extension 10 mm socket and 10 mm wrench or two 10 mm wrenches Pry bar Flat tip screwdriver 8 mm socket or wrench 17 mm wrench 6 mm hex key or long 6 mm hex head socket Procedure Place the car on ramps or jack stands. Remove the 8 mm nut on the back of the starter heat shield. Loosen (don't have to remove) the two bolts on the side of the clutch housing that hold the starter heat shield. Slide the heat shield off the starter and put it aside. Using the flat tip screwdriver, loosen the wastegate diaphragm hose clamp and disconnect the hose from the diaphragm. Next, I chose to remove the wastegate discharge pipe. This requires that you modify a 13 mm socket to fit between the head of flange bolts and the recesses in the flange. I used a bench grinder to grind down the sides of the open end of the socket until I could get it onto the bolts. Once you get the proper fit, remove the four discharge flange bolts. You'll need the universal joint and socket extension to get to a couple of the bolts. Using the 13 mm socket and ratchet, also remove the bolt (1) that attaches the discharge flange to the torque tube mounting bracket. Next, remove the two flange bolts at the other end of the discharge pipe. Using the pry bar, slide the discharge pipe in toward the torque tube and downward toward the starter. Once the flange on the discharge pipe clears the wastegate valve body, you should be able to remove the discharge pipe. Disconnect the triangle shaped flange bolt on the inlet pipe (3 bolts - 10 mm). Locate the two wastegate diaphragm bolts that hold the wastegate mounting bracket. Using a 6 mm hex key or long 6 mm hex head socket remove the two bolts. This should allow you to slide the wastegate off the mounting bracket and out of the car with the inlet pipe still attached. Installing the Wastegate With the inlet pipe attached to the wastegate, slide the end of the inlet pipe into the cross-over pipe flange and attach the wastegate to the mounting bracket with the two Allen head bolts. Torque the bolts to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs) using the 6 mm hex key or long 6 mm hex head socket. Torque the inlet pipe to cross-over pipe flange bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) using a 10 mm socket and wrench or two 10 mm wrenches. Install the wastegate discharge pipe. Torque the flange bolts (4) using the modified 13 mm socket and discharge pipe flange to torque tube bracket bolt (1) to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs). Torque the discharge pipe to main exhaust pipe flange bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) using a 10 mm socket and wrench or two 10 mm wrenches. Connect the wastegate diaphragm hose and tighten hose clamp.

The new style coolant pump has a guard rail for the timing belt an a larger idler roller (46.2 mm vs. 32.0 mm). The new style was installed on all cars produced after July 1986. I recommend installing the new style pump when replacing the water pump. For cars which previously did not have the new style pump installed, this requires modifying the rear timing cover and purchasing a belt guard and larger idler roller. Some of the new style pumps will come with the belt guard already installed so ask your parts supplier when ordering. The groove for the thermostat snap ring has also been moved. Previously, it was 4.5 mm from the sealing surface and is now at 7 mm. This requires the use of a new thermostat and spacer. On Turbocharged cars, there is a nozzle on the water pump which supplies cooling water to the turbocharger bearing housing. On Normally Aspirated cars the nozzle is a block-off plate. The block-off plate / nozzle is sealed to the water pump by an o-ring which should be replaced when the new pump is installed. On some pumps, the block-off plate / nozzle is mounted using a 6 mm stud and nut and a 6 mm x 20 mm bolt. However, most of the new pumps come with two bolt holes. This requires transferring the 6 mm stud from the old pump to the new one or purchasing another 6 mm x 20 mm bolt.

Using ENG-05, remove the balance shaft belt, timing belt, rollers, balance shaft sprockets, crankshaft gear, and rear timing cover. Using COOL-02, drain the cooling system to an appropriate catch pan. Disconnect the coolant hoses from the water pump. Loosen the water pump retaining bolts and nuts (10 mm socket) and remove the water pump from the car. Tip: This is a good time to inspect and replace the crankshaft and balance shaft oil seals. Install thermostat on new water pump using Snap Ring from old pump. On Turbocharged cars install the turbocharger thermostat and thermostat nozzle with o-ring on new water pump. On Normally Aspirated cars install the Block-off nozzle with o-ring on the new water pump. Install the new water pump using a new gasket (normally supplied with the pump). Note: The factory manual has you install the water pump fasteners using Loctite 270. This is fine for the nuts. However, I prefer to not use it on the bolts as is increases the probability of stripping the bolts holes during the next removal. Tighten the water pump nuts and bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs).

Spin the front wheel and listen for noise. Also, make sure the wheel rolls freely without excessive resistance. To check the wheel bearing adjustment, first remove the front wheel. Remove the wheel bearing grease cap by tapping around the back edge with of the cap with a hammer and chisel. On early models (pre-1985.5), the speedometer is driven by a cable off of the left front wheel. To remove the grease cap on that side, you'll first have to remove the E-clip from the end of the cable using a small flat tip screwdriver or probe. After the grease cap is removed, use the medium flat tip screwdriver to turn the bearing thrust washer (just behind the locking collar). When you try to turn the washer ensure that the screwdriver is not resting on the locking collar or on the hub. If the washer spins freely or if you are unable to turn the washer using the screwdriver, the wheel bearing needs to be adjusted. If adjustment is required, loosen the locking collar Allen head bolt using a 6 mm Allen head wrench or long Allen head socket. To get the wrench into the head you'll have to turn the hub until the detent in the lip of the hub lines up with the head of Allen bolt. Once the Allen head bolt is loosened, turn the locking collar as necessary to achieve proper adjustment on the bearing (as described in the previous steps). If the washer turns too freely, turn the locking collar in the clockwise direction to tighten the bearing. If the washer is too tight, turn the collar in the counter-clockwise direction to loosen the bearing. When the bearing is properly adjusted, tighten the Allen head bolt on the locking collar, replace the bearing cap, replace the front wheel, and lower the vehicle.

After the grease cap is removed, loosen the locking collar Allen head bolt using a 6 mm Allen head wrench or long Allen head socket. To get the wrench into the head you'll have to turn the hub until the detent in the lip of the hub lines up with the head of Allen bolt. Turn the locking collar counter-clockwise to remove it from the spindle. Then, pull the hub and rotor assembly as a unit straight off of the spindle. The thrust washer and outer wheel bearing will likely fall out of the hub when you slide it off the spindle so, be prepared to catch them. Pry the grease seal out of the back of the hub and remove the inner wheel bearing. Use the hammer and round punch to tap the bearing races out of the hub. Alternate tapping on one side of the bearing and then the other along the two channels inside the hub. If you do not have access to a brass punch, be extremely careful of the angle you hold the punch to keep from damaging the inner surface of the hub. Once both bearing races are removed, clean the inner surfaces of the hub thoroughly. Install the new bearing races into the hub as follows: Place the new bearing races in a freezer for a minimum of an hour, preferably overnight. Heat the hub assemblies in an oven at 250°F for at least 30 minutes. The longer you leave the hubs in the oven the easier the races will go into the hub. Using a pair of gloves, remove the hub(s) from the oven and place on a flat working surface which can not be damaged by the hub. Remove the races from the freezer and insert them into the hub. The bearing should drop right into the hub with little or no effort. Pack the new bearings with a good quality moly bearing grease. A bearing packer is the preferred method of packing the bearing but, they can be packed almost as well by placing the bearing in the palm of your hand and pushing grease into the bearing rollers using your fingers. Place the inner bearing into the back of the hub and install a new bearing seal. Place the hub assembly onto the spindle an insert the outer wheel bearing. Place the thrust washer and locking collar onto the spindle. Adjust the bearing as described in the &quot;Checking and Adjustment&quot; section of this procedure.

The reason being is that the axle nut is torqued to 350 ft-lbs. That means if you're using an 18&quot; breaker bar to remove the nut, you have to apply 233 lbs. of weight to the end of the bar. If you're using a 24&quot; breaker bar, you have to apply 175 lbs. of weight to the end of the bar. The problem is that over time, the threads of the axle/nut get a little rust built up on them and then it takes significantly more force than the 350 ft-lb. tightening torque to break the nut free. Sometimes this can double the amount of torque required. With that in mind, if we assume that the amount of torque required to remove the axle nut has doubled to 700 ft-lbs., it may require a breaker bar as long as 4 feet (48&quot;) to get the required weight applied to the end of the breaker bar down to where and average sized individual (175 lbs.) can apply enough force to break the nut free. I had an experience one time on my own car where I was trying the break the axle nut free where even with a 4 foot breaker bar and myself and a friend standing on the bar, we were unable to break the nut free. Finally, the only way I was able to free the axle nut was to drive the car to a shop that does tires for very large trucks. They loosened both axle nuts using a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench and then retighten them with a 1/2&quot; Drive Impact Wrench. Then, I drove the car back to my shop where I completed the job. So, if the following procedure for loosening the axle nut doesn't work, you may have to pursue a similar method to remove the nuts. Set the emergency brake to assist in removal of the axle nut. Loosen the rear wheel lug nuts on one wheel several turns. Raise that side of the vehicle using a floor jack. Remove the lug nuts and the rear wheel. Remove the cotter pin for the axle. Loosen and remove the axle nut as follows: First try loosening the axle nut using an appropriate size socket (32mm or 36mm depending on the vehicle) and long breaker bar. If you're lucky the nut will come of easily and you can proceed to Step 7. If this doesn't work, continue with the next step. Place the appropriate size socket on the axle nut. I recommend using an impact socket as a standard socket can easily be destroyed if significant torque is required to break the nut free. Attach a breaker bar at least 24&quot; long to the socket in a position parallel to the ground and rest the handle end of the bar on a jack stand (or something similar). Realize that to loosen the nut the breaker bar has to be pointed in the correct direction. For the left wheel, the breaker bar must be pointed toward the rear of the car. For the right side wheel the breaker bar must be pointed toward the front of the car. NOTE Make sure that the breaker bar and jack stand are positioned so that they can not damage any of the suspension components or body work when you lower the car. With the socket and breaker bar in position, slowly lower the floor jack until the weight of the car breaks the axle nuts free. If this does not work, borrow a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench or take the car to a shop with a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench to get the nut loosened. Most early 944s are equipped with spacers on the rear wheels which must be removed. Remove the rear brake caliper. Release the emergency brake. Using a Phillips head screwdriver remove the brake rotor retaining screws. Remove the rotor. It may be difficult to remove. However, the rotor has two threaded M8 holes for bolts to be threaded into for jacking the rotor off of the hub. Remove the parking brake pads, spreader, and brake dust guard (4-19mm hex head bolts). Remove the rear hub. Using the 8mm cheesehead tool, disconnect the CV joint from the trailing arm and hang the axle out of the way. Remove the stub axle using a gear puller or by driving it out with a block of wood and hammer. The inner spacer ring should come off with the stub axle. However, it will sometimes stick to the inner bearing seal. Remove the inner spacer ring and inspect it for scoring and replace if necessary. Remove the inner and outer bearing seals using a seal puller. Remove the snap ring next to the inner wheel bearing. Using a soft drift and hammer from the outside of the trailing arm, gently tap on either side of the inner wheel bearing to drive it evenly out of the trailing arm. Working from the inside of the trailing arm, tap on the outer wheel bearing using the drift and hammer to drive it evenly out of the trailing arm. Remove the bearing spacer tube from the trailing arm and clean out all the old grease. Pack both new bearings with grease. Install the new inner bearing using a socket as a driver or a soft face hammer. Make sure that the bearing goes into the trailing arm evenly to prevent binding. Also, make sure that the chamfered edge of the bearing is facing out (from the center of the trailing arm). Install the snap ring next to the inner bearing. From the outside of the trailing arm, pack fresh bearing grease into the trailing arm. Do not pack completely full. Allow room for installation of the bearing spacer and for expansion of the grease as it heats up. From the outside of the trailing arm, install the bearing spacer tube.

First, the aluminum trailing arm uses a single sealed bearing as opposed to a double roller bearing arrangement. The single sealed bearing is also a bit more difficult to remove from the trailing arm than the bearings in the steel arm. The Porsche factory manual describes removing the wheel bearing after the trailing arm has been removed from the car. The factory shop manual has you heat the trailing arm to 120 - 150 °C (approximately 250 - 300 °F). Then you press the bearing out from the back side of the trailing arm using special tool VW 432. Now, I'm sure this method works quite well. However, who wants to remove the trailing arm from the car just to replace the wheel bearing? Not me. So, I elected to use a slide hammer bearing puller to remove the bearing from the trailing arm. And, I didn't heat the trailing arm before removing the bearing. The bearing was a bit stubborn to remove. But, I'm sure it would have been much easier if I had heated the trailing arm first. Consequently, this procedure will differ somewhat from the factory shop manual procedure.

This troubleshooting procedure is intended to help you determine the cause of problems with the operation of your windows. Tools Test meter (Voltmeter/Ohmmeter) Trim removal tool (if door panel has to be removed) Phillips head screw driver (if door panel has to be removed) Power Window Troubleshooter Symptom Possible Cause Checks Window will not move Blown Fuse If the fuse for the power windows is bad, neither window will move. So, if the problem is only one one side, the fuse is good. Check Fuse: Early 944s (Pre-1985.5) - Fuse 8 (16A), Additional Fuse Panel Late 944s (1985.5 and Newer) - Fuse 4 (30A), Central Electric Panel Bad relay If the power window relay is bad, neither window will move. So, if the problem is only one one side, the relay is good. If you suspect that the power window relay is bad, you can remove the relay and jumper terminals 30 and 87 to power the window motors. When you install the jumper, you don't need to turn on the ignition switch to test/operate the power windows. On early 944s, the power window relay is located on the lower left side of the center console near the DME computer. On late model 944s, it's located on the Central Electric Panel (G7). Bad Window Switch / Bad Wiring If your window problem is only on one side, the cause is most likely a bad switch, bad wiring, or a bad window motor. The most common problem of these is the power window switch. So, we will first troubleshoot the switch and in the process check the wiring up to the switch. The passenger window switches (one on each door), are wired in series with the driver's side switch supplying power to the passenger's side switch. So, if you have a problem with the passenger's window it could be either side. The easiest way to test this is to take a known good switch (for example if the driver's window is working fine) and plug it into each of the switch locations for the passenger's window to see if you can get it to start working. Window Switch Test Windows Move Slowly Window Mechanism Dragging Lubricate Tracks on Window Mechanism. For instructions on removing the door panels to access the power window motor go to: Door Panels - Removal and Installation. Window Motor Check for proper voltage at power window motor plug when window switch is depressed. For instructions on removing the door panels to access the power window motor go to: Door Panels - Removal and Installation. Window Switch Test Remove the window switch to be tested from the door panel. There are four tabs on the window switches (two on top, two on bottom) which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when trying to release these tabs as they can be easily broken. I usually slide a small flat tip screwdriver under two of the tabs at the same time to release them (see picture below). Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Using a voltmeter, on the switch plug, check for approximately 12 VDC from terminal 4 (RD/GN) to ground and terminal 5 (RD/BL) to ground. Proper voltage verifies the power supply and wiring up to the window switch is good. Using an ohmmeter check the window switch as follows: When the window switch is depressed in the open direction (see diagram above), you should read a low resistance (less than 1 ohm) from terminals 1 to 4 and terminals 2 to 3. When the window switch is depressed in the close direction, you should real a low resistance from terminals 1 to 3 and terminals 2 to 5. If the measurements taken above are not within specification, the window switch is bad. In this case, you have two options. You can replace the switch or you can disassemble the switch and clean the contacts. If you wish to try and clean the window switches, refer to the Window Switch Repair section below. Window Switch Repair Introduction The majority of problems with window switches are the result of dirty contacts. Most of the time, the window switches can be disassembled, the contacts cleaned, and the switches reassembled and they'll function just like new switches. Sometimes however, the switches are worn to the point that the switches will not operate smoothly and they may have to be replaced. Procedure The window switch terminal block on the back of the switch is held in place by four tabs (two on each side) which fit into detents in the switch body. Remove the terminal block by inserting a small flat tip screwdriver into the side of the terminal block on the back of the switch. Make sure you have the back of the switch facing up or the switch internals will fall out when you remove the terminal block. When the terminal block is off, remove the switch internals and inspect the switch contacts. If you measured the switch contact resistances in the switch testing section and the resistances were high, you'll likely find dirty switch contacts (see picture below).  Clean the switch contacts and reassemble the switch. See the picture below for a comparison of the contacts before and after cleaning. After reassembly, check switch for smooth operation and test in accordance with the Window Switch Test section. NOTE The switch shown in the previous pictures was a non-operating switch which was repaired by simply cleaning the switch contacts.

Personally, I have not had the opportunity to use this procedure yet. So, for now, we have to assume that the factory procedure works as written. If you attempt to use this procedure and determine that changes need to be made, please let me know. The airbag system has an internal diagnostics system which continuously monitors the condition of the system. Any faults in the system are indicated by an &quot;Airbag&quot; warning light on the instrument cluster. When the ignition is turned on and when the engine is started, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light illuminates and remains lit for 5 seconds. If no faults in the system are detected, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light will then extinguish. Testing the air bag system will require you to make up a test rig to apply a ground to the air bag test connector. The Air Bag Warning Light Reset procedure (ELECT-12) contains instructions for fabricating the test rig. After the ground is applied to the test connector, the &quot;Airbag&quot; light will blink in a series of codes to indicate the faults stored in the system's memory. It takes approximately 2 minutes to detect all faults once the test is started. Therefore, the ignition switch must be on for at least 2 minutes during the test.

Depress and hold the switch/pushbutton on the test. Turn the ignition switch on. Release the test rig pushbutton 3 seconds after the ignition switch is turned on. Count and record the lamp blink codes. The lamp blink codes will run as follows: a. 5 second lamp test. b. Light flashes 1 or more times depending on the number of faults. c. After 3 seconds the fault codes will start. d. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the fault code group. e. 3 second pause. f. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the line in the fault table. g. 3 second pause. Page 1 of 8 h. Light flashes 1 to 4 times to indicate the column in the fault table. i. 3 second pause. j.

Using the lamp code table, determine the system faults and take corrective actions as described in the &quot;Correcting Faults&quot; section. 8. After all testing is complete and all faults have been corrected, reset the airbag warning light (ELECT-12). The flash code test may be repeated as often as desired.

However, to my knowledge it first appeared in the 944 FAQ which is now maintained by Kevin Gross. If anyone knows who originally came up with this, please pass the info along so I can provide appropriate credit. This procedure is used to reset the air bag warning light on all 944s equipped with air bags. This is normally required when the steering wheel (and hence the air bag) are removed for work on the dash, instrument cluster, or steering column switches. This procedure does not work for 968s as they require a Bosch Hammer diagnostic tool to reset the air bag warning light. Under the dash on the passenger's side of the vehicle (LHD cars), you'll find a white Molex connector with three female pins (diagram below). The center pin (Pin #2) is used to apply a ground to the connector in a series of specific timed steps to reset the air bag warning light. You can use a wire with a pin connector to make the ground connection or the bare end off a wire that has been tinned with solder. In either case, make sure you have a good connection in the pin (i.e. if using the bare end of a wire make sure the fit is snug enough that the wire will not fall out).

Khalil Spencer came up with the idea for this test rig. The tool is shown in the diagram below. All of the components are available at an electronics store (Radio Shack, for example). You may have to try several different sizes of pin connectors to find the correct size to fit in the hole on the air bag reset Molex connector (see introduction for location of connector). You can also obtain the correct connector from Porsche (PN 171.971.998 B). Alternatively, you can also leave the pin connector end off and tin the end of the The pushbutton switch is a momentary contact switch (SPST Momentary). In other words, it is spring loaded and the switch is closed as long as the button is pushed. The switch opens when the button is released. Procedure (Two Jumpers) 1. Turn the ignition switch to the off position. 2. Install the jumper with the pin connector or bare end of wire into Pin #2 of the white Molex connector (passenger's side under dash). Route the alligator clip end of the jumper to the vicinity of the driver's seat. 3. Install the second jumper (two alligator clips) to a grounding point (metal door latch is typically used). Route the other end of the jumper to the vicinity of the driver's seat. Note: During the reset procedure you will be connecting and disconnecting the alligator clips from the two jumpers to provide a ground on the center pin of the Molex connector. 4. Connect the alligator clip ends of the two jumpers. 5. Turn the ignition switch to the on (run) position but, do not start the car. 6. After five seconds, disconnect the wire jumpers. 7.

Working on the 944 A/C system is no different than working on any other automotive A/C system. They have all the same components which function in the same manner as any other A/C system. First, if you're having a problem with the A/C system on your 944, there are two ways you can approach solving the problem. The first is to just start replacing components and hope you get lucky by replacing the faulty component the first time. The other method involves doing some actual testing to narrow down the cause of the problem. In order to properly test the A/C system and narrow down the possible causes of your problem, you're going to have to invest in a set of A/C gauges. Before we begin with the actual troubleshooting, to properly troubleshoot the A/C system, it's extremely helpful to understand how the automobile A/C cycle works. So, we'll begin by discussing automotive air conditioning theory of operation. There are two basic types of automotive air conditioning systems. The type of system is determined by the device used to control the expansion of the high pressure, high temperature liquid to a low pressure, low temperature liquid. One system uses and expansion valve while the other uses an orifice tube. 944s use an expansion valve system. We'll discuss the operation of both. The first component in the A/C cycle is the compressor. The compressor takes low temperature refrigerant gas and compresses it into a high pressure, high temperature gas. The refrigerant is then sent to the condenser which sits in front of the radiator. The condenser removes some of the heat from the refrigerant which causes the refrigerant to change phase from a hot gas to a warm liquid. In the expansion valve A/C system, the warm liquid is then passed through a receiverdrier which removes moisture (via a desiccant in the drier) from the refrigerant to maximize the efficiency of the heat exchange capability of the refrigerant. On 944s, the receiver-drier is a small canister (probably with a sightglass on top) located near behind the driver's side headlight (LHD cars). No phase change occurs as the refrigerant passes through the receiver-drier. From there, the refrigerant is then passed through the expansion valve. The expansion valve has a sensing line that is attached to the suction of the A/C compressor. The expansion valve senses the pressure at the suction of the A/C compressor and modulates to maintain the pressure at the compressor suction. On 944s, the expansion valve is located near in the passenger's footwell (LHD cars) near the center console next to the firewall. Page 1 of 5 In the orifice tube system, the warm liquid refrigerant passes directly from the condenser to the orifice tube. The orifice tube is a fixed expansion device. The pressure drop across the orifice tube is proportional to the pressure into the orifice tube. So, the orifice tube system maintains the pressure at the suction of the A/C compressor by cycling the compressor on and off via a clutch. This is the type of system typically used by GM vehicles. The expansion of the warm liquid through the expansion valve or orifice tube causes a pressure drop and hence a temperature drop in the refrigerant. So, out of the expansion device we get a low temperature liquid refrigerant. The next component in the A/C system is the evaporator. Air from the passenger's compartment passes across one side of the coils in the evaporator. The low temperature liquid refrigerant passes through the other side of the coils. The refrigerant removes heat from the air in the passenger's compartment and returns to the A/C compressor suction as a low temperature gas (phase change). In the orifice tube system, there is an accumulator located between the evaporator and the A/C compressor suction. The accumulator has moisture removal desiccant just like the receiver-drier used in the expansion valve system. However, it also collects any unevaporated refrigerant to prevent liquid lock of the compressor. This can occur due to the cycling action of the compressor. The diagrams below show the two different A/C system cycles. Page 2 of 5 Tools · A/C Gauges and hose set A/C System Troubleshooting The following is an general A/C system troubleshooting guide.

Slide the connector off the plug. NOTE Two electrical wires are secured to the air flow sensor via a small red plastic clip and L-bracket. You can either try to pull the clip from the small L-bracket that it mounts to, or you can remove the L-bracket from the air flow sensor assembly. I recommend the later, as it is a single bolt, and when I attempted to do the former, I broke the red plastic clip. (Comment from TMH) Page 1 of 5 d. Remove the bolts at the front of the air filter housing (attaches the air filter housing to the bracket at the radiator cross-member). (Comment from TMH) e.

Using a 17mm socket and ratchet or 17mm wrench, remove the banjo bolt on the turbocharger discharge pipe. Be careful when removing the bolt. There are two metal seal rings on either side of the banjo connector that can easily be dropped when the bolt is removed. They can be nasty to retrieve if the fall in the wrong spot. c. Remove the turbocharger discharge pipe from the car. Page 3 of 5 d. Using the jeweler's screwdriver or straight probe, push back the ends of the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor electrical connector until they rest on the side of the connector. Slide the connector off the plug. e. Using the 5mm Allen head socket or hex key, loosen the filter housing retaining bolts. There are actually four bolts. However, due to it being so difficult to remove and install, you may find the last bolt is missing. If it is installed, you'll find it by looking behind the sensor housing on the right side of the air filter housing. Chances are you'll have to remove the top of the air filter housing to even see it. The short end of a 5mm hex key is about the only thing that will access it. Don't completely remove the bolts as it will simplify the installation. f. Loosen the clamp that holds the rubber inlet plenum boot to the air flow sensor. g. Lift up on the left side of the air filter housing and slide the entire assembly toward the left side of the car as you lift it out. Some folks remove the filter housing inlet tube prior to removal to make things a little easier. If you wish to do so, remove the two Phillips screws on top of the air filter housing first. Installation 1. Normally aspirated cars: a. Lower the air flow sensor/air filter housing assembly into the car. Ensure the air flow sensor outlet is inserted into the end of the rubber inlet plenum boot. b. Locate the filter assembly mounting bracket on to the studs on the upper radiator cross-member. Install and tighten the bracket retaining nuts. Tighten the clamp on the rubber inlet plenum boot for the air flow sensor. c. Ensure the wire retaining clip on the air flow sensor wiring harness connector is properly positioned and slide the connector on to the sensor plug. d. Connect the breather hose to the air filter housing and tighten clamp. Page 4 of 5 2. Turbocharged cars: . Lower the air filter housing assembly into the car and slide the air flow sensor outlet into the rubber inlet plenum boot. As you lower the air filter housing into the car, the mounting bolts (Allen head) should insert into the notched mounting brackets. This ensures the housing is properly aligned. If your model is equipped with a timing belt cover breather hose, attach the hose to the bottom of the filter housing as you lower the unit into the car. NOTE Later model cars are not equipped with the breather hose and will have the hose connection on the bottom of the housing capped. Also, some early models may still have the attachment on the timing belt cover but, it has been capped as well. a. If the air filter housing inlet tube was removed install the tube on the housing using the two Phillips head screws. Tighten the air filter housing mounting bolts (Allen head - 5mm) and the clamp for the air flow sensor outlet on the rubber inlet plenum boot. b. Install the turbocharger discharge pipe. It's easier to install if you insert the end into the rubber hose near the radiator first. Tighten the hose clamps on either end of the tube. Attach the banjo bolt connection to the discharge pipe (17mm wrench or socket). Be sure to install the seal rings on the either side of the banjo bolt connector. c.

Also, covered is a procedure for testing the AFM and correcting problems related to erratic operation. If you'd like more detailed information about the operation of the AFM, FR Wilk has written a very comprehensive article on the AFM. The article is located at http://www.frwilk.com/944dme/afm.htm. What I've provided below is simply a summary of that article. Operation There are two different Air Flow Meters used on 944s although externally they are similar in appearance. Both AFMs use a flapper or barn door arrangement where, as air flow through the meter increases, it forces the barn door further open. The movement of the barn door moves a wiper arm across the conducting strip of a variable potentiometer. The sensor has a voltage applied to it which is supplied by the DME computer. As the barn door opens and the wiper arm moves across the variable potentiometer, the output voltage from the AFM increases. This output signal is sent back to the DME to be used as an air flow signal. The primary differences between the early 944 AFM (pre-1985.5) and the late AFM is that the input voltage from the DME computer is different and the type of output signal from the AFM back to the DME computer is different. In both AFMs, the DME uses a ratio of the supply voltage (from the DME) to output voltage (from the AFM) for air flow signal development . The early AFM receives an unregulated 12 VDC supply from the DME. The voltage output from AFM is not proportional to the change in barn door position but instead increases exponentially as the barn door is opened. The output signal is however, proportional to the increase in air flow. Consequently, what the DME receives from the meter is in effect an actual air flow signal. On the later AFMs, the input voltage from the DME is a regulated 5 VDC supply. The output signal from the AFM is a voltage that increases linearly as the barn door opened. What this does is to simplify the construction of the later AFM. However, it now requires the DME to interpolate the input signal from the AFM to obtain an air flow signal. The main problem that occurs with the AFMs over time is that the wiper arm contacts wear grooves in the conducting strip of the variable potentiometer. When that happens it can lead to erratic voltage output from the AFM which will cause the car to hesitate or stumble as you accelerate. In the picture below you can see the potentiometer conducting strip and the grooves in the strip. In the AFM shown the grooves in the strip are not yet bad enough to cause erratic operation of the AFM. Page 1 of 9 NOTE The AFM can be tested in the car. However, it is extremely difficult and I prefer to remove the AFM for testing. Page 2 of 9 Testing the AFM (Installed) Note: Here's a drawing which which shows the terminal numbers. Realize that you're looking into the end of the wiring harness plug. So, the terminals on the AFM plug will be reversed from the terminals show below from the plug. Note: The terminals on the AFM itself are label 1-2-3-4. The terminals on the wiring harness plug correspond as follows: Plug Terminal 22 7 9 6 AFM Terminal 1 2 3 4 Connection Air Temperature Sensor Output Voltage to DME Input Voltage from DME Ground Page 3 of 9 1. Push back the protection sleeve on the air flow sensor connector. The connector remains attached. Connect a voltmeter to terminals 9 and 6 on the back of the connector. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. If you have an early 944 (pre-1985.5), the voltmeter will probably read approximately battery voltage (12 VDC). However, it should read a minimum of 8 VDC. If you have a late model 944, the voltmeter should read 5 VDC +/- 0.5. This is the AFM input voltage. 2. Connect the voltmeter between terminal 7 on the back of the connector and ground. Here you should read 150 - 250 mV. 3. Slowly push the sensor plate (barn door) to the full open position using a not-tohard, smooth item inserted through the filter intake opening. The voltage should rise to slightly less than the input voltage measured in Step 1. You are measuring the output voltage in this step. The voltage should rise steadily with not drop in voltage or erratic changes in voltage. If this happens, there are dead spots in the AFM potentiometer conducting strip. You may be able to correct this by bending the AFM wiper arm. This will be discussed later. 4. Check temperature sensor I (intake air temperature). Turn the ignition switch off and pull off plug on air flow sensor. Connect and ohmmeter between terminals 6 and 22 on air flow sensor (both outer male terminals on the sensor plug). With air temperature between 15 - 30 °C, the ohmmeter should read 1.45 - 3.3 k-ohms. If the air temperature sensor reads open, it will cause a rich mixture. If it reads a short, it will cause a lean mixture. Page 4 of 9 Test Procedure (AFM Removed) Tools · · · · · · Multimeter Test Leads 9 VDC Battery 9 V Battery Connector Small Female Spade Connectors (2) Electrical Tape Making Up Test Connections To test the AFM with it removed from the car, you'll need a voltage source. The simplest solution to this is a 9 VDC battery. To make up the leads, I went to Radio Shack and obtained a 9 V battery connector which had leads with bare ends connected to it. Next, you'll need to crimp a small female spade connector to each of the bare ends. Again, you'll probably have to go to an electronics store and look for the smallest female spade connectors they have. I had small female spade connectors. However, they were actually one size larger than what I needed. So, I had to wrap the spades with electrical tape to keep the from touching when connected to the AFM connector. Test 1. With the AFM removed from the car, remove the cover from the AFM. It will be glued to the body of the AFM by a bead of silicon sealant. You'll have to cut the sealant bead at the bottom edge of the cover where it mates to body of the AFM. You can use a sharp knife or razor blade to cut the sealant. Page 5 of 9 2. Here's a look at the inside of the AFM electronics: 1. Input Voltage Terminal (from DME) 2. Ground 3. Temperature Sensor Output 4. Sensor Output Voltage (to DME) 5. Potentiometer Wiper Arm 6. Potentiometer Resistor Board 7. Potentiometer Conducting Strip Page 6 of 9 3. Connect the 9 VDC battery negative lead to Terminal 4 on the AFM connector and the positive lead to Terminal 3. 4. Connect the voltmeter negative lead to the ground terminal (2) on the inside of the AFM and the positive lead to the sensor output voltage terminal (4). You should obtain a small voltage indication on the voltmeter. Using a new 9 volt battery which was reading 9.41 VDC prior to the test, I obtained slightly less than 0.5 VDC (.463 volts to be exact). 5. Slowly open the AFM barn door and observe the voltage. The voltage indication should increase steadily as the barn door is opened with no drops or large fluctuations in voltage. With the barn door full open the voltmeter should read slightly less than input voltage. In my case with the 9.41 VDC input voltage, I obtained an full open output voltage of 8.45 VDC. 6. If any voltage drops or large fluctuations in voltage are noted, there are probably dead spots in the potentiometer conducting strip. This can sometimes be corrected by changing the position of the wiper arm. That will be discussed in the next section. Page 7 of 9 AFM Cleaning and Repair Sometimes erratic operation of the AFM can be caused by dirty contacts, dirty conducting strip, or due to grooves worn in the AFM potentiometer conducting strip. This section covers cleaning the AFM and changing the position of the AFM wiper to correct erratic operation. 1. With the AFM cover removed (see preceding sections), clean the AFM potentiometer conducting strip using a pencil eraser. Work carefully and don't be to aggressive when using the eraser. 2. Clean the contacts on the bottom of the wiper arm (see picture below) using emery cloth or fine grit sandpaper (400 grit). The best way to do this is to disassemble the AFM enough to remove the wiper arm. If you don't feel comfortable disassembling the AFM, you can clean the wiper arm in place. However, you need to insert a sheet of paper between the wiper arm and the conducting strip first. Then clean the contacts by inserting the sandpaper or emery cloth between the paper and the contacts on the bottom side of the wiper arm. The paper serves to protect the conducting strip while cleaning the wiper arm contacts. 3. Now that you've cleaned the AFM, it's a good idea to test it again to see if the cleaning has corrected the problem with erratic operation. If it does not correct the problem, and it's obvious that there are deep grooves in the potentiometer conducting strip, adjust the wiper arm position as described in the following step. 4. Place a piece of paper between the wiper arm and the potentiometer conducting strip. Change the position of the wiper arm by pushing down on both sides of the back part of the wiper arm (see arrows in picture below) to bend the arm slightly. This effectively shortens the arm such that the contacts on the bottom side of the arm will ride on a different (ungrooved) part of the conducting strip. Page 8 of 9 5. Test the AFM as described in previous sections to determine if erratic operation is corrected. If not, the AFM should be replaced.

This requires disconnecting the alarm module and installing two jumpers in the electrical connector plug. Tools · Two wire jumpers with spade connectors Procedure 1. First, locate the alarm module. It's a black box approximately the size of a pack of cigarettes. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), it's located behind the radio in the back of the center console. On late model 944s, it's located behind the kick panel in the passenger's footwell near above the DME computer. 2. Disconnect the electrical plug from the alarm module. 3.

However, it is somewhat time consuming since a large number of parts have to be removed to actually get to the alternator. The cost of a new alternator is pretty steep. However, there are an increasing number of shops which do fine rebuilds on Bosch alternators. So, I recommend checking around in your area to see if there are any reputable rebuild shops before spending the money on a new alternator. If you can't keep you car off the road long enough to wait for a rebuild, purchasing a new or rebuilt alternator is really your only option. However, if your alternator supplier doesn't require a core, have your old alternator rebuilt anyway. At worst you'll have a spare alternator. You may even be able to sell your rebuilt alternator to another owner to recoup some of the money you spent on the new alternator.

While ramps are more convenient I find I have more room to work with the car on jack stands. 3. Remove the skid pan from under the engine compartment (M6 bolts - 10 mm socket) Page 1 of 3 4. Remove the Alternator/AC compressor belt as follows: a. The normal method of removing the alternator belt is to loosen the lock nuts on either end of the AC Compressor turnbuckle tensioner and rotating the turnbuckle until the tension is eased from the Alternator / AC Compressor belt. Then the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the alternator can be removed and the alternator rotated toward the engine to allow removal of the belt. b. The alternate method, which I prefer, is to loosen the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the compressor a few turns, then relieve the tension on the turnbuckle using the pry bar between the compressor and the block. While holding the pry bar in position, remove the turnbuckle retaining bolt on the compressor, rotate the compressor toward the engine, and remove the belt. The reason I prefer this method is that, assuming the belt was properly tensioned before removal, the belt can be reinstalled by reversing this procedure and little or no belt adjustment is required. c. If the car is equipped with power steering the Alternator / AC Compressor belt can not be completely removed without first removing the power steering belt. However, the belt does not have be completely removed unless it needs to be replaced. 5. Loosen and remove the lower alternator retaining bolt at the back of the compressor. NOTE Some 944s have an air cooling supply via a flexible duct from the left front fender well to a black plastic shroud attached to the back of the alternator. These must be disconnected to remove the alternator from the car. 6. If equipped, remove the flexible hose which goes from the front left fender to the black plastic shroud on the back of the alternator. This may be done using a stubby flat tip screwdriver or, if the clamp is oriented correctly by using a long thin blade flat tip screwdriver. Yes, it is important that this hose be reinstalled as it supplies cooling air to the alternator. 7. Remove the air box and air flow meter from the vehicle. 8. On turbocharged cars perform the following: . Remove the intercooler outlet pipe to the intake manifold. Also, remove the rubber inlet plenum boot (to turbocharger). a. Drain as much coolant as possible from the coolant expansion tank using a hand vacuum pump or siphon pump. b. Disconnect the coolant hose from the coolant expansion tank to the crossover pipe and to the turbocharger cooling pump. Have some rags ready to catch the remaining coolant left in the hoses. 9. Remove the remaining alternator retaining bolts. 10. If equipped, lift the alternator sufficiently to remove the black plastic cover on the back of the alternator. Page 2 of 3 11. Disconnect the wires from the back of the alternator and remove the alternator from the vehicle. Installation 1. Place the new alternator into the vehicle. Ensure the rear alternator cover is in position before installing the alternator. 2. Connect the wires to the alternator and attach the cover to the back of the alternator. 3. Install the alternator retaining bolts. However, do not tighten yet. 4. Install the alternator belt. 5. If not already done, install the bottom nut for the rear alternator cover. 6. Install the AC compressor turnbuckle to tension the AC Compressor / Alternator belt. 7. Tighten the alternator retaining bolts. 8. Install the cooling duct for the alternator. 9. For turbocharged cars performed the following: a. Install the coolant hose from the coolant reservoir to the crossover pipe and turbo cooling pump. b. Install the rubber inlet plenum boot on the turbocharger suction. c. Install the intercooler discharge pipe to the intake manifold. 10. Install the air flow meter and air box. 11.

It will also provide instructions for resealing the balance shaft cover. At the back of the balance shaft housing there is also a large diameter plug which uses an o-ring to seal the rear of the housing. I don't normally recommend replacing this o-ring or resealing the balance shaft cover unless they actually start leaking. The reason for this is that removing the balance shaft covers can require significant disassembly of engine components, particularly on turbocharged cars. Also, on 1985½ and newer models, there is a seal between the upper balance shaft bearing cap and cover. This seal is used to direct oil flow from the upper balance shaft bearing to a fitting on the balance shaft cover which supplies the turbocharger on turbocharged cars. On normally aspirated cars the balance shaft cover is not tapped for a turbocharger oil supply fitting. However, the normally aspirated cars use the same bearing cap as the turbocharged cars. The seal must be installed to ensure adequate lubrication of the upper balance shaft bearing. If the balance shaft cover needs to be resealed or the rear sealing plug o-ring needs to be replaced, the bearing cap-to-cover seal must be replaced at the same time. This is not a concern on models through early 1985 as the bearing cap is machined integral to the balance shaft cover.

NOTE It is possible to remove the timing belt with out removing the balance shaft belt gear on the crankshaft. However, it is extremely difficult to install the new belt with the balance shaft gear in place. Rather than risk damaging the belt, I prefer to install the flywheel lock and remove the balance shaft gear. If you choose not to, the steps associated with installing the flywheel lock, removing the crankshaft pulley bolt, and removing the power steering and balance shaft gears may be deleted. 4. Using ENG-03, install the flywheel lock. 5. Remove the alternator and power steering pump belts. Page 3 of 5 6. On Turbo models, remove the turbocharger outlet line to the intercooler (Large diameter aluminum tube to which the air filter assembly is clamped). 7. Using AF-01, remove the air cleaner housing and air flow sensor assembly as a unit. 8. Remove the front engine cover to access the timing and balance shaft belts (The cover is two pieces and is attached by 10mm head bolts). 9. Remove the crankshaft pulley bolt using a 24mm or 15/16&quot; deep socket. Remove the power steering pulley. Remove the alternator/AC pulley and balance belt gear as a unit from the crankshaft. 10. Loosen the balance shaft belt tensioner sprocket lock nut, then turn the tensioner nut counterclockwise to release the tension on the balance shaft belt. 11. Loosen the balance belt idler idler roller lock nut, then rotate the idler to provide clearance for removal of the balance shaft belt. 12. Remove the balance shaft belt and mark the direction of rotation on the belt if it is to be reused. 13. If the balance shaft belt idler and balance shaft tensioning roller are to be inspected or need to be removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the locknuts and slide the rollers off the shafts. 14. If the balance shaft sprockets need to be removed (i.e. water pump or oil seals), the sprockets will have to be locked in place to allow the retaining nuts to be loosened. Use the Balance Shaft Pin Spanner to hold the sprocket while loosening the retaining nut. You can also use two large punches and a set of locking pliers to hold the sprocket, but this is very awkward. 15. After the retaining bolts have been removed, slide the balance shaft sprockets straight off the shaft. You may need to slide a small pry bar behind the sprocket to get it started. 16. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap and the aluminum cover behind the distributor cap. This will reveal the main camshaft sprocket. 17. If the timing belt is to be reused, mark the belt for direction of rotation before removing it. 18. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: . Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. Hold the flats on the tensioner roller with an open end wrench while loosening the locknut to provide counter-torque. Failure to provide counter-torque while loosening (or tightening) the locknut causes stress on the tensioner roller stud which can lead to long-term failure. a. Remove the timing belt, being careful not to twist the belt if it is to be reused. It may be necessary to remove the balance belt gear on the crankshaft to allow removal of the timing belt. b. If the camshaft tensioning roller is to be inspected or removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the lock nut and slide the camshaft tensioning roller off the shaft. Page 4 of 5 19. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: a. The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. b. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can also be done using the factory balance shaft spanner if you have one. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. This will allow you to install the new belt without having to fight the spring tensioner. c. Remove the timing belt, being careful not to twist the belt if it is to be reused. d. If water pump or oil seal maintenance is being performed, the spring tensioner must be removed. Remove the entire spring tensioner assembly as a unit. The three bolts on the face plate of the spring tensioner are not used to remove the unit. There are three bolts (which are very difficult to see) at the back of the tensioner near the block which must be removed to get the assembly out. NOTE On spring tensioner cars, I find it very difficult to remove and install the timing belt with the spring tensioner assembly in place. I prefer to remove the spring tensioner assembly from the car during belt removal and reinstall while timing belt is being routed during installation. 20. If the camshaft belt idler is to be inspected or removed for other maintenance (i.e. water pump or oil seals), remove the retaining bolt and the camshaft belt idler. 21. If the crankshaft gear needs to be removed (i.e. water pump or oil seals), a gear puller is the easiest method. However, if a gear puller is not available, you can slide a pry bar behind the gear to get it started. If you use a pry bar, apply pressure gently so that you do not damage the rear timing belt cover (it's made of plastic). 22. The back timing cover can now be removed by removing the 10mm bolts holding it in place. The back timing cover must be removed when replacing the water pump, front crankshaft oil seal, and the balance shaft oil seals.

Pre-tension the camshaft belt by turning the tensioning roller eccentric nut (thin 24 mm or thin 27 mm open end wrench) counter-clockwise until the belt can be twisted 90° using the thumb and forefinger. This should be checked at the midpoint between the cam sprocket and the crankshaft sprocket. Tighten the tensioning roller locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Apply counter-torque to the tensioning roller eccentric nut while tightening locknut to prevent altering the belt tension. Note: Originally, this was the only method of tensioning used on 928s and 924s. I know of several shops that have never purchase Special Tool 9201 and use this method on 944s as well. However, it is very risky and I strongly recommend checking the belt with the factory tensioning gage. Belt Tensioning (1987 Model and Newer Cars With Spring Tensioner) 1. Release the spring tensioner by loosening the locking nut and locking bolt near the spring end of the tensioner. 2. Tighten the locking bolt and locknut to 20 Nm (15 ft-lbs). Checking and Adjusting Cam Belt Tension (All Cars) Yes, all cars. While some people contend that the tension does not need to be checked on cars with spring tensioners, I would disagree. From experience, I've found that spring tensioners vary from car to car and will not apply the same tension consistently when the spring is released. The spring tensioners seem to get close enough to the 2.7 ±0.3 spec for a used belt to be of little concern. However, the spring tensioner WILL NOT tension a new belt to within the tolerance for a new belt (4.0 ±0.3) unless the spring is released, the engine is rolled a degree or two, and then the tensioner is tightened down. The problem is that since spring tensioners tend to vary, you don't know exactly how many degrees to roll the engine. That's why it's important to check the tension using Special Tool 9201. Page 3 of 7 Procedure 1. After the camshaft belt has been pre-tensioned, remove the flywheel lock if installed. NOTE Do not install starter until crankshaft bolt is installed and torqued as the flywheel lock will need to be installed again. 2. Turn the engine clockwise two complete turns using the crankshaft pulley bolt (15/16&quot; or 24 mm) and align the mark on the camshaft sprocket with the alignment tab in the window on the distributor housing (TDC). Verify that the crankshaft is also at TDC by checking the &quot;OT&quot; mark in the window on the bell housing. 3. Turn the crankshaft 10° counter-clockwise. This is approximately 1.5 teeth on the camshaft sprocket. 4. Check the belt tension using Special Tool 9201. Pull the lock pin on the tool to release the tension roller. Align the drag needle with the gage needle. Install the tool on the long section of the cam belt between the cam sprocket and the cam belt idler roller. Make sure that the tool's tensioning roller is on the toothed side of the belt. NOTE When checking timing belt tension, the timing belt tool is installed such that the gauge on the tool is oriented upside down. It also requires the flat bars on the tool to slide between the timing belt and the timing belt cover which is a snug fit. This is perfectly acceptable. Page 4 of 7 5. Push the tensioning roller against the cam belt until the locking pin on the tool engages. Read the tension on the dial. Tension specs: New belt - 4.0 ±0.3 Used belt - 2.7 ±0.3 6. Adjusting tension on cars with eccentric roller tensioners: a. Adjust the belt tension by loosening the tensioning roller locknut and turning the tensioning roller eccentric nut (thin 24 or thin 27 mm open end wrench) counter-clockwise and tighten locknut. Apply counter-torque to the eccentric roller when tightening locknut to prevent altering torque. b. Repeat the steps above until the cam belt tension is within the specified tolerance. c. Torque tensioner locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Page 5 of 7 7. Adjusting tension on cars with spring tensioners: a. On the front plate of the spring tensioner there are three fasteners. One holds the roller in the tensioner. The other two are used to tension the belt. To tension the belt, simply loosen the lock nut on the pivot arm (top fastener) and the locking bolt (lower). You'll notice a slot behind the head on the lock bolt. Loosening the lock nut and bolt allows the tension to be released on the spring to retension the belt. b. Using a pry bar or balance shaft pin spanner, you may want to gently nudge the tensioner in release direction (i.e. more tension on the belt). Sometimes after sitting for a while the spring tensioners like to stick. Once you're satisfied that the tensioner has released, tighten the tensioner lock nut/bolt. c. Spring tensioners tend to be a bit unreliable as far as consistency in tensioning. I recommend checking the tension with the factory tool, the twist method (described previously in this procedure), or with an aftermarket tension tool (i.e. Optibelt, Market, etc.) NOTE The intended tool for this purpose is the balance shaft sprocket pin spanner (P9200). The spanner pins fit into two holes on the front of the spring tensioner body. Balance Shaft Belt Tensioning (All Cars) 1. Determine the amount of belt tension required for the type of belt you have. Old style belt (15 mm wide) - 2.7 ± 0.3 New style belt (18 mm wide) - 3.5 ± 0.5 2. Loosen the locknut on the balance belt idler roller and move it away from the balance belt. It should not come in contact with the belt while checking the tension or during tension adjustment. 3. Check the belt tension using Special Tool 9201. Pull the lock pin on the tool to release the tension roller. Align the drag needle with the gage needle. Install the tool on the section of the balance belt between the lower and upper balance shaft sprockets. Page 6 of 7 4. Adjust and recheck the belt until the tension is within the specified limits. NOTE If you have someone to help you it is possible to adjust the belt tension while the tensioning gage is installed. However, the tension should be checked again after the tensioning roller locknut is torqued. 5. When the belt is set at the proper tension, tighten the locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Apply counter-torque to the tensioning roller to prevent changing the belt tension. 6. Adjust the balance belt idler roller such that the clearance between the roller and the belt at the lower balance shaft sprocket is 0.5 mm. This can be done with Special Tool 9207. I normally use a 0.5 mm feeler gauge. When properly adjusted, torque the locknut to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). Clark's Garage © 1998 Page 7 of 7");sQ1[222]=new Array("pdf-manual/eng-07.pdf","Balance Shafts - A Little History and Why 944s Use Them","","ENG-07, Balance Shafts - A Little History and Why 944s Use Them One of the complaints that many 924 owners had about their cars were related to vibrations. Large in-line four cylinder engines inherently produce large second order harmonic vibrations. To solve this problem, Porsche elected to use a balance shaft system on the 944. The balance shaft system was actually invented by Frederick Lanchester, an English inventor, in the early 1900's. However, it was Mitsubishi that eventually patented the idea which they called the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; system. Porsche developed their own balance shaft system for the 944 apparently using three bearings instead of the two employed by the Mitsubishi system. However, Porsche discovered that the Mitsubishi system worked better. So, Porsche paid Mitsubishi a royalty of 6 - 8 US dollars per car to use the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; system. Each balance shaft has two counterweights which resemble small hockey pucks with the shaft running through them. The two counterweights are about an 1-1/2 inches apart (or approximately 4 cm). The section of the shaft between the counterweights is machined for the main balance shaft bearing. The balance shaft turns the counterweights at twice the speed of the engine. With one located high on one side of the engine and the other low on the opposite side of the engine, the balance shafts turn in opposite directions from each other and balance the vibrations of the large spinning mass inside the engine. By the way, Frederick Lanchester in credited with a number of very significant inventions including disc brakes which he invented in 1903. Clark's Garage © 1998 Page 1 of 1");sQ1[223]=new Array("pdf-manual/eng-08.pdf","Balance Shaft Sprocket Installation and Alignment Check","","ENG-08, Balance Shaft Sprocket Installation and Alignment Check Introduction If your 944 is experiencing vibration problems, the cause could be a balance shaft misalignment. This can occur if the balance shaft belt slips a tooth, the balance shaft belt is broken, or if the balance shaft sprockets are installed incorrectly. Quite often, balance shaft sprocket misalignment occurs after water pump, crankshaft oil seal, or balance shaft oil seal replacement. The following procedure will tell you how to correctly install the balance shaft sprockets and how to check them for proper alignment if you suspect that the sprockets may have been installed incorrectly. Other Procedures Needed · ENG-13, Locating and Setting Engine to Top Dead Center (TDC), Cylinder 1 Installation Each balance shaft sprocket has two slotted grooves on the inside diameter. One of the grooves on the sprocket will slide onto a woodruff key which is inserted into a slot near the front end of the balance shaft. On 1983 and 1984 model 944s, each balance shaft sprocket was stamped on the front with an &quot;O&quot; (Ober or Over) beside one of the slotted grooves and a &quot;U&quot; (Unter or Under) beside the other slotted groove. As one might have guessed, on the upper balance shaft, the groove with the &quot;O&quot; stamped beside it was installed onto the woodruff key, and on the lower balance shaft, the groove with the &quot;U&quot; stamped beside it was installed onto the woodruff key. I'm not sure what prompted Porsche to do it but, on cars produced after 1984, only the slotted groove with the &quot;O&quot; was stamped. The groove which previously had the &quot;U&quot; stamped beside it, now has nothing. This is when problems started to occur with balance shaft misalignment. Mechanics who weren't previously familiar with 944s and who didn't pay close attention when they disassemble the balance shaft assemblies naturally assumed that on both shafts the &quot;O&quot; should go on the woodruff key. This causes the lower balance shaft to be 180 degrees out of alignment. The resulting vibration is actually worse than if there were no balance shafts at all. So, the important thing to remember is that on the later cars, the groove with the &quot;O&quot; goes on the woodruff key on the upper balance shaft and the groove with nothing stamped beside it goes on the woodruff key on the lower shaft. Page 1 of 2 Checking Balance Shaft Alignment One of the most important parts of ensuring proper balance shaft alignment is ensuring the balance shaft sprockets are properly installed. Since we've already discussed proper installation, you should have no trouble installing them correctly. However, if everything is assembled, how do can you tell if the sprockets are correctly installed ? 1. With the balance shaft sprocket covers installed, it is impossible to actually see the woodruff key to determine proper alignment. 2. Each balance sprocket cover has a number of round openings and one rectangular opening. At the rectangular opening, there is a tab on the back of the cover which gets inserted into the groove that does not have the woodruff key. 3. If the sprocket is properly installed on the upper balance shaft, the &quot;O&quot; stamped on the sprocket will be visible in one of the round openings on the cover. 4. If the sprocket is properly installed on the lower balance shaft, the &quot;O&quot; stamped on the sprocket will be visible in the rectangular opening on the cover. NOTE The only problem with this method is that sometimes the tabs on the back of the sprocket covers get broken off. If this is the case, the only way to positively determine proper installation is to remove the sprocket retaining bolts, remove the cover plate, and slide a heavy piece of wire or a small probe into each groove to determine the location of the woodruff key. 5. Once you're sure the sprockets are installed correctly, the balance shafts can be checked for proper alignment as follows: a. Using ENG-13, set the engine to TDC on cylinder #1. b. With the engine at TDC the notch on the back lip of the upper sprocket should align with the notch on the rear timing belt cover (approximately 1 o'clock position). c. For the lower balance shaft, the notch on the back lip of the sprocket should align with the raised tab on the inside of the back timing belt cover (approximately 7 o'clock position). d. Sometimes you'll find that the notches on the sprockets don't line up exactly. This is not uncommon. About half the 944s I've seen don't. However, with one sprocket dead on it's alignment mark, the other sprocket should be no more than about 1/2 tooth off. If it's out of alignment by 1 tooth or more then it should be realigned. Clark's Garage © 1998 Page 2 of 2");sQ1[224]=new Array("pdf-manual/elect-15.pdf","Battery Checks","","ELECT-15, Battery Checks Introduction Performing a visual inspection of the battery is an important first step in determining the condition of the battery. If the visual checks don't reveal anything obviously wrong with the battery, proceed with the battery condition testing. Visual Checks 1. Check the battery for cracks in the case. 2. Check the battery terminals for corrosion. This will appear as white or rust colored material on the battery terminals / connectors. a. If corrosion is evident, loosen and disconnect the battery clamps. Clean the battery posts and clamps with a wire brush. b. After reconnecting the terminal leads, apply petroleum jelly to the post and clamps to minimize corrosion. You can also the felt rings for the battery posts to help reduce corrosion. 3. On 944s, a battery cover is important to minimize corrosion and protect the battery tray. 4. Check for bulges in the battery cases. This is indicative of a failing battery. Battery Condition Check The best way to check the condition of a battery is to take it to an auto parts store and have it professionally tested. However, you can check the state of charge of an automotive battery by checking the no load voltage of the battery. This must be done with a good quality digital multimeter with an accuracy of 0.5% or better. Disconnect the battery positive lead, check the battery terminal voltage, and compare to the table below. No Load Voltage (VDC) State of Charge 12.75 12.45 12.25 12.05 11.85 100% 75% 50% 25% 5% If ambient temperature is less than 21 °C (approximately 70 °F), then add 0.021 volts to the reading for every 1 °C (1.8 °F) below 21 °C (approximately 70 °F). Page 1 of 3 Another way to check the condition of the battery is to check the specific gravity of each cell using a hydrometer. However, as most battery are now sealed units, this is normally not possible. Replace the battery if any of the following conditions exists: a. O VDC across a battery that's been charged 6-8 hours. This means there is and open cell in the battery. b. Approximately 10.0 - 10.6 VDC across a battery that's been charged for 6-8 hours. This means that there is a shorted cell in the battery. c. After being charged for 6-8 hours (at 13.8 to 14.6 VDC) the battery will not hold a charge of at least 12.45 VDC. Additional Information Another way to tell if the battery has sufficient charge to roll the engine is to take a look at the interior lights. If the interior lights are extremely dim or won't light at all, there is not enough charge in the battery to roll the engine. Charging a 944 Battery The best method to charge a battery is to charge slowly using an automatic constant voltage charger. You should charge the battery for 6 - 8 hours at 13.8 to 14.6 VDC. Charging at less than 13.8 VDC or greater than 14.6 VDC can shorten the life of a battery significantly. Page 2 of 3 Jump Starting a 944 Connecting jumper leads or battery charger leads to a 944 poses an interesting problem. The battery positive terminal is located in close proximity to the windshield frame. Consequently, it's difficult to connect a jumper or battery charger lead clamp to the terminal without touching the windshield frame (DC arc welding lesson 101). I avoid this by clamping onto the battery positive terminal with a pair of needle-nose vise grips and then attach the charger or jumper lead to the vise grips. I recommend connecting jumper or battery charger leads in the following order: a. b. c. d.

Particularly if you own a 944 which has it's DME located in the passenger's footwell. When the battery tray leaks, water drips onto the DME wiring harness and runs into the DME control unit case. On turbocharged cars, the KLR unit can be affected as well. Leaking battery trays normally occur when the battery tray drain clogs and water stands in the battery tray for long periods of time. It can also occur if the battery cover is missing. Water running off the windshield (from rain or when you wash your car) runs on top of the unprotected battery and washes acid from the outside of the battery to the bottom of the battery tray. It is therefore important that the battery be removed periodically, the tray cleaned thoroughly, and the drain checked to ensure it is draining properly. Procedure There are several different methods which may be used to repair a leaking battery. I will describe two of the methods here. The method chosen depends on the extent of the damage to the battery tray. The method required may also determine whether the projects are within the capability of the shade tree mechanic as well. Determining Which Repair Method to Use If there are no visible holes in the bottom of the battery tray or the holes a very small in size &quot;Method 1&quot; may be used. However, if the battery tray has large holes or there is a general weakening of the battery tray bottom (flexes easily when pushed on) &quot;Method 2&quot; should be used. Method 1 As already stated, Method 1 should only be used if the damage to the battery tray is relatively minor. 1. For 944s whose DME control unit is located in the passenger footwell, or in the case of 944 Turbos, the DME and KLR control units, the control units should be removed before attempting any repairs to prevent damage to the control units. 2. First, check the battery tray drain to see if it is clogged and clean it out if necessary. You can check the drain by pouring a cup of water into the tray and see if it drains readily. Since you know your tray is leaking, you should stuff some rags around the underside of the tray to absorb any leakage. Then, the entire battery tray should be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution and rinsed thoroughly. This includes removing any debris that's too large to be flushed out the drain (i.e. leaves, etc.). Page 1 of 3 3. Next, scrape the bottom of the battery tray with a metal scraper to remove any loose paint. If there is any discoloration of the paint (i.e. rust color) or any rusted metal is exposed, the tray must be treated with a rust converter. This will convert the rusted metal back to a form that can be painted. On light colored cars discoloration of the paint in the battery tray is very easy to identify. However, with medium and dark colored paint, it is difficult, and sometimes almost impossible to identify all areas where there may be rust forming under the existing paint. For dark colored cars, I recommend removing as much of the paint from the bottom of the battery tray as possible. Then, treat rusted areas with rust converter as required. There are several different versions of rust converter. MarHyde makes a very good converter which is applied with a brush. I've used the Mar-Hyde brand with results on my own car. I obtained it at a local auto paint supply dealer. I've also used a rust converter which comes in a spray can which I bought at Wal-Mart (sorry can't remember the brand). Be sure you wear gloves, mask, and eye protection when working with the rust converter. You DON'T want to get any on your skin. I'm told it will discolor your skins and takes an extremely long time to wear off. 4. After the rust converter is completely dry, coat the entire bottom of the battery tray with a &quot;brushable seam sealer&quot; (that's the stuff with brush lines in it that you see all over the engine compartment in a 944). For bare metal, it is desirable to prime the surface before applying the seam sealer. 3M makes a good brushable seam sealer that's available at most auto paint supply stores. If you're worried about aesthetics try to make your brush strokes similar to other areas under the hood where brushable seam sealer has been applied at the factory. 5. After the seam sealer is dry the battery tray may be painted to match the rest of the car's paint. Normally, the seam sealer does not need to be primed prior to painting. 6. After the battery tray is repaired, ensure that the battery has a battery cover installed. This with help prevent acid from being flushed off of the battery terminals during rainy weather or when the car is being washed. Also, make sure you remove the battery periodically and clean the tray. Make sure the battery tray drain is clear during cleaning. Page 2 of 3 Method 2 Method 2 should be used if there is significant damage to the battery tray. I won't describe this method in great detail because it is beyond the capability of most shade tree mechanics. In this method, the bottom of the battery tray has been damage to the point that it is not repairable. So, the bottom of the tray must be removed and a new tray bottom installed. 1. First, determine how much of the battery tray bottom must be removed and mark the area with a permanent marker, paint, scratch awl, etc. Remove the affected area using a cutoff tool, cutting torch, or if you have access to one (I hate you) plasma cutter. 2. Next, make a template for the replacement bottom by having someone hold a sheet of paper against the bottom of the tray and tracing the cutout area onto the paper. 3. Use the template to transfer the drawing of the replacement bottom to the metal plate you intend to use for the bottom. You may choose to use carbon, galvanized, or stainless steel. I prefer galvanized or stainless for obvious reasons but, it depends on what type of welding equipment you have available. 4. Cutout the new bottom and tack weld in to place in the tray to keep it from moving while you complete the welding. Use a hand grinder to clean up the welds on the tray side of the bottom (the underside isn't as critical). 5. Coat the entire bottom of the battery tray with a &quot;brushable seam sealer&quot; (that's the stuff with brush lines in it that you see all over the engine compartment in a 944). For bare metal, it is desirable to prime the surface before applying the seam sealer. 3M makes a good brushable seam sealer that's available at most auto paint supply stores. If you're worried about aesthetics try to make your brush strokes similar to other areas under the hood where brushable seam sealer has been applied at the factory. 6. After the seam sealer is dry the battery tray may be painted to match the rest of the car's paint. Normally, the seam sealer does not need to be primed prior to painting. After the battery tray is repaired, ensure that the battery has a battery cover installed. This with help prevent acid from being flushed off of the battery terminals during rainy weather or when the car is being washed. Also, make sure you remove the battery periodically and clean the tray. Make sure the battery tray drain is clear during cleaning.

Since most of the 944 engine is aluminum the steel bolt thread tend to bond to the aluminum. Because of this, almost everyone who has ever worked on a 944 engine has stripped an Allen head or cheesehead bolt at some time. To help prevent this, I'll share this tip I learned from a mechanic friend of mine. &quot;Waking Up&quot; the Bolts 1. Using a punch or socket extension and a hammer, tap around the outside head of the bolt. 2. For Allen head bolts, tapping on the inside of the Allen head opening with a punch and hammer is effective as well. 3. While attempting to remove the bolt, ensure that the Allen head tool or cheesehead socket remains inserted straight into the head of the bolt. This requires using two hands, one to hold the tool straight into the head and the other to turn the tool. 4. If the bolt does not break free easily, tap the head again.

Since 1984, all 944 models and the 968 are equipped with wear indicators. When the brake pads are worn to the point that the wear indicators make contact with the rotor, a light will be illuminated on the dash to indicate that the pads need to be replaced. However, the wear indicators can become damaged and should not be considered 100% reliable for indicating when the brake pads should be replaced. The Brake System should be checked every 15,000 miles as a minimum. However, you should also check the brakes any time you have the wheels removed for other maintenance.

Looking from the side of the brake caliper you can see the brake pad and rotor in the opening in the caliper. 4. Measure the distance between the metal backing plate on the brake pad to the surface of the rotor. This is the brake lining thickness. 5. If the brake lining thickness is 5/64&quot; (2 mm), replace the brake pads. However, due to differences in brake lining rivet thickness Porsche generally recommends replacing pads if the linings are less than 2.5 mm (3/32&quot;). 6. If you have difficulty measuring the brake lining thickness, remove the brake pad and measure the thickness of the lining. ' 7. Also, inspect the brake calipers, hoses, and fittings for signs of leakage or cracking and repair/replace as necessary. Page 1 of 2 Parking Brake Inspection 1. Park the vehicle on a steep hill with the transmission in neutral. 2.

However, the wear indicators can become damaged and should not be considered 100% reliable for indicating when the brake pads should be replaced. The wheels must be removed to check the brake pads. The brakes should be inspected each time the tires are rotated. For models with tires that can not be rotated (i.e. different sizes tires front and rear), the brakes should be inspected every 15,000 miles as a minimum. Any time the wheels are removed, it's a good idea to inspect the brakes. The minimum allowed thickness for the brakes pads is 2 mm. However, Porsche generally recommends replacing the brake pads at a thickness of 2.5 mm.

Using the 19 mm socket and ratchet or breaker bar, loosen the lug nuts (two turns only) on the wheels where brake pads are going to be replaced. 2. Place the car on jack stands. 3. Remove the wheels for the brake pads to be replaced. 4. Remove the old brake pads. On 944 / 944S cars perform the following: a. Remove the cotter pins from the brake pad retaining pins. b. Remove the spring lock (also referred to as the anti-rattle spring) from the brake pad retaining pins. c. Using a hammer and flat tip punch, drive the retaining pins out of the brake pads / calipers. d. If equipped, remove the wear pad indicators (wire coming off one of the brake pads). Be careful removing the wear indicators as the clips break easily. NOTE As the brake caliper is pressed outward, brake fluid is being force back into the brake reservoir. Keep a close eye on brake fluid reservoir level while pressing out caliper to prevent overflowing the reservoir. If level gets too high, remove some of the fluid from the reservoir using a turkey baster or a vacuum pump brake bleeder. e. Using a large flat tip screwdriver or small pry bar, press the movable part of the brake caliper outward. Do not press against the rotor if possible. Pressing against the brake pad is okay since it's going to get replaced anyway. f. Using needle nose or lineman's pliers, remove the inner and outer brake pads. Page 2 of 4 On 944 S2 / 944 Turbo / 968 cars perform the following: a. Using channel lock pliers, compress the spring clip in the middle and disengage from the support by pushing the spring clip inward toward the brake rotor. Move the clip support away from the top of the clip and pivot the clip out away from the caliper. b. Remove the wear pad indicator by lifting the wire lead from the groove in the brake caliper and disengaging the wear pad from the brake pad plate. NOTE As the brake caliper piston is pressed outward, brake fluid is being force back into the brake reservoir. Keep a close eye on brake fluid reservoir level while pressing out caliper piston to prevent overflowing the reservoir. If level gets too high, remove some of the fluid from the reservoir using a turkey baster or a vacuum pump brake bleeder. c. At this point, I normally insert a small pry bar between the brake pad vibration backing plate (if equipped) and the back of the brake pad to press the caliper piston fully out (flush with the surface of the caliper). This may be difficult as the vibration dampers are attached to the brake pad plate by an adhesive backing. Prying between the vibration damper and the pad prevents damaging the caliper piston seals. Leaving the old pad in place will normally allow you enough leverage to move the caliper piston(s) fully out. Moving the piston fully out prior to removing the old pad ensures you have enough room to install the new pads. If the old pads do not have vibration backing plates, pry between the brake pad and the lip of the rotor (taking care not to damage the rotor) enough to loosen the pads and then insert a thin piece of sheet metal between the pad and the caliper pistons. The pry between the sheet metal and the brake pad to move the caliper pistons as previously described. d. Using lineman's pliers or needle nose pliers remove the old brake pads. 5. Using clean rags and brake cleaner clean the calipers and rotors prior to installing new brake pads. 6. Many of the replacement brake pads are now provided with vibration damper backing plates. If they are provided, I recommend using them on any 944. However, when asbestos-free pads are used on models with fixed calipers (i.e. one piece calipers), the vibration dampers MUST be used. If vibrations dampers are not provided, double-sided adhesive tape may be used instead. Porsche recommends using Scotch-3M No. 9485 (38 mm wide). Page 3 of 4 7. Install the new brake pads into the calipers. On 944 / 944S cars perform the following: a. Insert the brake pad retain pins. b. Using a hammer and flat tip punch, drive the pins into the fully engaged position. c. Install the locking spring and cotter pins onto the brake pad retaining pins. A flat tip screwdriver may be needed to compress the locking spring during installation. On 944 S2 / 944 Turbo / 968 cars perform the following: a. Pivot the spring lock toward the rotor. b. Using a pair of channel lock pliers, compress the spring lock in the middle and push into position against the rotor. c. While pushing against the spring lock with the pliers, move the spring clip support into position at the top of the clip. 8. Repeat the above steps until all the brake pads that need replacing have been replaced. 9. Install the wheels and lug nuts. Tighten the lug nuts to 130 Nm (96 ft-lbs). 10. Remove car from jack stands. 11. Ensure parking brake is engaged. You may also wish to install wheel chocks. 12. Check brake fluid reservoir level and fill if necessary. 13. Start vehicle and pump brakes until the brake pedal has a solid feel at it's normal pedal height. Do not move vehicle until this is done. Check brake fluid reservoir level again after pumping brakes. 14. If brakes feel spongy after pumping, bleed the brakes using BRAKE-01. 15. Take the car for a drive (few miles) making a few stops along the way. Make easy stops at first and then progressively harder, quicker stops. The will help ensure the brake pads are seated properly. An acrid, burning smell and some smoke from the brakes is normal until they are properly seated.

This means that it will readily absorb moisture. In fact, it will absorb moisture out of the air. Moisture in your brake fluid does two things. When the brake fluid becomes hot under hard braking, the water in the brake fluid boils. This causes steam voids in the brake system which causes a dramatic reduction in braking capability. In severe cases it can cause braking capability to be lost completely. Moisture in the brake system also causes internal corrosion of brake system components resulting in loss of braking capability. Therefore, it is extremely important to change your brake fluid at the specified intervals. Your brake fluid should be changed at least once per year and more frequently if the car is tracked. In fact, some PCA regions require that your brake fluid be changed within three months of a driving event. Make sure you use a good DOT 4 brake fluid. DO NOT use DOT 3 or DOT 5 fluid. For cars that are frequently tracked, you should use a brake fluid with a higher boiling temperature. ATE Super Blue is one of the more commonly used high temperature brake fluids.

Determine the correct size wrench for the bleeder and remove the rubber boot cover from the bleeder. Position the other person in the driver's seat. b. Have the person in the driver's seat pump the brakes several times and then hold the pedal in the depressed position. NOTE Once the bleeder is opened the person holding the brake will feel the pedal go to the floor. This is perfectly normal and they should NOT remove their foot from the pedal until directed to do so by the person doing the bleeding. If they release the brake while the bleeder is open, air will be drawn into the brake system making it more difficult to vent. c. Open the bleeder and catch the brake fluid that comes out in the container. When fluid stops coming out, close the bleeder. The person in the car may now release the brake pedal. d. Repeat the steps above until clean brake fluid comes out of the bleeder. e. Wipe up any spilled brake fluid with the catch rags. NOTE On 944 Turbos, 944 S2, and 968s there are two bleeders on each caliper. Bleeding should be done separately through each bleeder on the caliper. f. Repeat this process until all four brakes are done. g. For cars equipped with hydraulic clutches, the clutch should be bled at the slave cylinder as well. Page 2 of 3 7. If bleeding is to be done by one person with a hand vacuum pump type bleeder, perform the following: . Position the vacuum pump, appropriate size wrench for the bleeder screw, and catch rags at the caliper and remove the rubber boot from the brake bleeder. a. Connect the vacuum pump to the tip of the brake bleeder (Figure 1). Most vacuum pump kits now come with a variety of adapters. Find an adapter that will provide a tight seal on the brake bleeder. b. Pump the vacuum pump about 10 times and open the brake bleeder. c. As fluid comes out of bleeder into the container, continue to pump the vacuum pump until clean brake fluid starts to come out of the bleeder. d. If the container fills prior to getting clean fluid, stop bleeding by closing the bleeder. Empty the vacuum pump container and start bleeding again. e. When clean fluid comes out of the bleeder, close the bleed screw. f. Wipe up any spilled brake fluid with the catch rags. NOTE On 944 Turbos, 944 S2, and 968s there are two bleeders on each caliper. Bleeding should be done separately through each bleeder on the caliper. g. Repeat this process until all four brakes are done. h. For cars equipped with hydraulic clutches, the clutch should be bled at the slave cylinder as well.

You may actually have a master cylinder and brake booster from different manufacturers. Girling master cylinders are stamped with a &quot;G&quot; while Teves master cylinders are stamped with &quot;Ate&quot;. Also the stops screws are in different locations. On the Teves, the stop screw is on top of the master cylinder between the ports for the reservoir tank. On the Girling, the stop screw is on the side. Page 1 of 2 If you are merely replacing the master cylinder, it doesn't really matter which master cylinder you have or which one you get as a replacement. It really only matters if you decide the rebuild the unit yourself in which case the rebuild kits will be different. Before deciding on whether to rebuild or replace, first check the prices on a new or rebuilt unit as compared to a rebuild kit. If the replacement unit is not significantly more expensive than the rebuild kit, it may be worth you while to simply replace since the replacement unit will probably come with at least a one year and possibly a two year warranty (two year warranty if it comes from Porsche). Removal 1. Place catch rags underneath the brake master cylinder. Attempt to keep brake fluid from coming in contact with painted surface. 2. While not absolutely necessary, I normally drain as much fluid from the brake reservoir as possible before beginning as it minimizes the mess and cleanup afterwards. I normally use a hand vacuum pump to drain the reservoir. 3. After you drain the reservoir (if you chose to do so), remove the reservoir by pulling straight up on it. It may be necessary to rock it back and forth slightly to free it from the rubber grommets which mount the reservoir to the master cylinder. Be sure to catch any residual brake fluid which escapes from the reservoir using the catch rags. 4. Place the reservoir over to the side on the fender well (leaving the slave cylinder line and level sensor wires attached) .Place rags underneath to catch any remaining fluid 5. Remove the two retaining nuts that hold the master cylinder to the brake booster and remove the master cylinder from the car. Installation 1. Most master cylinders will come with instructions for filling the unit prior to installation. This usually involves installing the reservoir tank onto the master cylinder and installing nipples into the brake line ports with clear tubing routed back to the reservoir. 2. Fill the reservoir with fresh brake fluid. 3. Press on the master cylinder piston to force fluid through the clear plastic lines. Continue to do this until no more bubbles appear in the lines. 4. Attach the master cylinder to the brake booster using the two retaining nuts. 5. Attach the brake lines to the master cylinder. 6. Bleed the brakes and clutch. Check for leaks while operating the brakes and that the brakes and clutch are functioning properly.

If the run out exceeds 0.05 mm, the hub should be replaced. 8. If the hub run out is within limits, the brake rotor run out may be reduced by installing thin shims on the wheel studs or brake rotor mounting bolts between the hub and the rotor. It may also be reduced to within limits by having a machine shop resurface the rotor. If the lateral run out can not be reduced to within limits, the rotor should be replaced.

This bar mounts to the rear seat shoulder belt mounting points. I did this hastily so, the details will be a little sketchy. I will come back and add more detailed instructions at a later date. I ended up using reinforcement plates in several locations on the aluminum channel as it bends very easily when the fasteners are torqued down. Realize that these instructions may need to be modified based on the type of camera you have. So, study the instructions before you start and take some measurements of your own video camera to ensure that they will work. Tools · · Hack Saw Drill and Drill Bits Materials · · · · · · · · · 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel 49-1/4&quot; long 2 pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide x 4-1/2&quot; long 1 piece of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide 6&quot; long 2 pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate 1-1/4&quot; wide by 1&quot; long 5 - 1/4&quot; bolts x 1-3/4&quot; long (standard thread) 4 - 1/4&quot; nuts 2 - 7/16&quot; fine thread bolts (don't know the exact pitch) 1 - 1/4&quot; C-clip Rubber padding to go between camera and camera bar. Page 1 of 5 Construction 1. Take a piece of 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel and cut it to 49-1/4&quot;. 2. Cut two pieces of 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate to 1-1/4&quot; wide x 4-1/2&quot; long. These will be for the bracket mounting bars. 3. From the two pieces of steel cut above, make the bar mounting brackets as follows: a. Make a 90° bend approximately 1&quot; from the end of the plate. The camera bar will rest on these part of the plate. b. Approximately 1-3/4&quot; from the inside of the 90° bend made in the step above, make a 35° bend in the same direction as the 90° bend (see picture below). c. Drill a 1/2&quot; hole in the part of the bar that was bent to the 35° angle. d. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole in the part of the bar that was bent to the 90° angle. 4. Cut two pieces of 1/8&quot; galvanized plate 1-1/4&quot; wide x 1&quot; long. These will be used for a reinforcement plate where the brackets are bolted to the 1-1/4&quot; aluminum channel. 5. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole in the center of the reinforcing plate. Page 2 of 5 6. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole through each end of the aluminum channel. Before you drill, mark the hole location using the 3/8&quot; hole you drilled in the end bracket you constructed to determine the exact location of the hole. 7. Attach the bracket and reinforcing plates to each end of the aluminum channel using a 1/4&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; bolt and nut. 8. Fabricate a 1-1/4&quot; x 6&quot; reinforcing plate from 1/8&quot; thick galvanized steel plate. 9. Drill 3/8&quot; mounting holes through the reinforcing plate and aluminum channel so that the plate will be centered on the camera bar. Attach the reinforcing plate to the bar top of the camera bar using two 1/4&quot; x 1-3/4&quot; bolts and nuts. 10. For mounting the camera, most camera mounts use a standard 1/4&quot; standard thread. However, you may need a different mounting bolt depending on your camera. Page 3 of 5 11. Drill a 3/8&quot; hole for the camera mounting bolt through the center of the reinforcing plate and aluminum channel. Insert a 1/4&quot; bolt x 1-3/4&quot; bolt from the bottom side of the camera bar and check the amount of penetration through the top side of the bar. If the bolt penetrates too far through the bar, you won't be able to tighten it enough to get the camera to sit flush with the bar. I ended up using two flat washers between the bolt and the bottom of the bar to provide enough spacing. 12. The mounting bolts for the bar are a bit difficult to locate. The bar mounts to the rear seat shoulder belt mounting points. If your car is equipped with rear shoulder belts (early cars are not, later cars are), you can simply use the shoulder harness mounting bolts. If the car is not equipped with shoulder harnesses, the mounting points with have plasitc plug inerts. These can NOT be used to mount the bar as they are not strong enough. Personally, I had trouble locating the correct size bolt to fit the mounting point. It appears that it is approximately an 11 mm bolt with a fine thread. I ended up using a 7/16&quot; fine thread bolt approximately 1&quot; long which worked well. 13. The next part isn't critical but, it's a nice feature which you may want to take the time to add. Page 4 of 5 14. I wanted to leave the camera mounting bolt in the bar all the time. So, I cut a channel around the part of the bolt where it penetrates the top of the bar and installed a C-clip to hold it in the bar. However, if you do this, you'll also have to install some rubber padding on the reinforcing bar to provide spacing for the Cclip so the camera will sit flush. 15. Another feature I added was a security strap for the camera. I simply added another plate on the bottom side of one of the reinforcing plate bolts for the strap to attach to. In most track events, the governing sponsor of the event normally requires a safety strap for the camera.

Ensure that all old gasket material is removed from the mating surfaces on the head and the camshaft housing. If a scraper is used to remove the old gasket material, do so carefully to prevent gouging or scratching the mating surfaces. Minor scratches in the mating surface may be removed with emery cloth or fine grit sandpaper. 2. Ensure that the rear distributor housing and cam sprocket are installed. 3. Set the alignment mark on the cam sprocket to the alignment mark on the rear distributor housing (i.e. TDC). 4. If old lifters are to be reused, ensure that all lifters are installed in the same location their were in on removal. 5. If new lifters are being installed, be sure to soak them in oil for several hours prior to installation. After soaking them for a period of time, compressing them between the fingers along with additional period of oil soak will minimize the time for the lifters to properly &quot;self-adjust&quot; after initial startup. Page 1 of 2 NOTE A coat of grease on the outside of the outside of the lifters will help hold the lifters in the cam housing during installation. 6. Place a new cam housing gasket onto the cylinder head mating surface. If correctly oriented the letters &quot;OBEN&quot; or &quot;TOP&quot; will be facing up. Correct orientation is important as the oil supply passage to the cam housing (lifters and cam bearings) can otherwise be blocked. 7. Ensure the engine is aligned to TDC (ENG-13). 8. Place the cam housing onto the cylinder head and ensure that it engages the alignment pins on the head. The cam housing will not sit flush with the cylinder head as some of the cam lobes will be positioned to try and open their respective valves. NOTE As the cam housing bolts are tightened, the cam may move slightly from the TDC alignment mark. This is expected. 9. Install the cam housing bolts (M8). A small amount of grease in the head of the Allen bolt or on the tip of the Allen head socket will hold the bolt on the socket while installing inside the cam housing. Remember to install the coolant return pipe when installing the cam housing bolts. There is no specified tightening sequence for the cam housing bolts. However, they should be tightened so that the cam housing is pulled down evenly onto the alignment pins. Once the housing is fully seated on the head, torque the cam housing bolts to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs). 10. Install and tension the camshaft belt using applicable portions of ENG-06 and ENG-10. 11. Install the front timing covers. 12. Using FUEL-02, install the fuel rail and injectors. 13. Using IGN-01, install the distributor cap and rotor. 14.

Remove the alternator and power steering belts. Remove the front timing covers. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap and rotor. Remove the front distributor housing cover. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: a. Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. Hold the flats on the tensioner roller with an open end wrench while loosening the locknut to provide counter-torque. Failure to provide counter-torque while loosening (or tightening) the locknut causes stress on the tensioner roller stud which can lead to longterm failure. 8. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: . The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. a. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can also be done using the factory balance shaft spanner if you have one. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. Page 2 of 10 9. With the timing belt detensioned, slide the timing belt off the camshaft sprocket. Figure 1. Page 3 of 10 Figure 2. NOTE Use the cam housing exploded drawing above and the component reference numbers in the preceding steps to determine the location of various components. 10. The camshaft sprocket is held in place by a retaining collar (Figure 1, 18). Mounted in a recess in the end of the retaining collar, there is a connector to which the ignition rotor is mounted (Figure 2, 26). After removing the rotor and the front distributor housing, remove the bolt (10 mm socket or wrench) which holds the connector in the collar and remove the connector by pulling straight out of the collar. It can be difficult to remove and may require heating the outside of the recess in the camshaft to loosen. Page 4 of 10 11. Behind the connector, you will find an M10 x 65 mm bolt in a recess in the retaining collar (Figure 1, 19). This bolt holds the retaining collar and camshaft sprocket to the end of the camshaft. On some cars this may be a hex (Allen) head bolt or a cheesehead (12 point internal). If the car is equipped with a hex head bolt, Porsche calls for the bolt to be replaced with a cheesehead bolt. Since the torque spec for the cheesehead bolt is significantly higher than the hex head bolt, I suspect that there have been problems in the past with these bolts backing out and that Porsche went to the cheesehead bolt to allow a higher torque value. However, that's merely conjecture on my part. 12. Using a 10 mm cheesehead tool or hex tool, remove the retaining collar bolt. Before attempting to remove the cheesehead bolt, make sure you &quot;wake up&quot; the bolt by inserting the cheesehead tool into the bolt head and tapping the tool with a hammer several times. Page 5 of 10 CAUTION DO NOT ALLOW THE CAMSHAFT SPROCKET TO TURN MORE THAN A FEW DEGREES while loosening the cheesehead bolt. If so, the valves will contact the pistons and possibly cause damage. You will have to hold the flats on the camshaft sprocket retaining collar (1-1/4&quot;) with an open end or combination wrench while turning the cheesehead bolt. This is somewhat awkward. Because of the lip on the rear distributor housing you can not get the open end of a combination wrench onto the flats of the collar straight on. However, you can get the wrench on the flats at a slight angle and still remove the cheesehead bolt. I've found that using the closed end of a combination wrench, because the head is at an angle, works better. Cheesehead bolts tend to strip very easily. It's important to hold the tool straight and fully inserted into the bolt while loosening. Therefore, a second person to hold the wrench on the flats of the collar while you remove the cheesehead bolt is almost a necessity. Page 6 of 10 13. Once the cheesehead bolt is removed, the retaining collar and camshaft sprocket will slide straight off the end of the camshaft. Do not try to turn the sprocket or retaining collar while removing. They are positioned on the camshaft by a woodruff key. So, turning the camshaft or retaining collar will also turn the camshaft. 14. Remove the woodruff key from the slot in the camshaft. I've found that a pair of diagonal cutters or needle nose pliers works well for removing the key. Page 7 of 10 15. Remove the bolts (3) which hold the rear distributor housing to the camshaft housing. 16. Slide the rear distributor housing off the camshaft. 17. In the back of the rear distributor housing, you'll find a spacer (Figure 1, 20). More than likely the spacer will come out with the rear distributor housing as it is held by the main camshaft seal. If so, you'll see a thin mylar (plastic) seal (Figure 1, 23) on the end of the camshaft that you need to replace. If the spacer did not come out with the rear distributor housing simply slide it off of the camshaft and replace the seal. 18. There are three seals on the rear distributor housing which must be replaced. The main shaft seal (Figure 1, 22) goes into the front of the housing. There is also a large o-ring (Figure 1, 21) and smaller round seal (Figure 1, 13 - See NOTE below) which go in the back of the housing to seal between the distributor and camshaft housings. Apply a small amount of engine oil or bearing grease to the seals prior to and after installation. Page 8 of 10 NOTE Figure 1 shows the small round seal (13) being installed at the front of the cam housing. That is somewhat misleading. The seal does mate to the front of the cam housing but, for mounting purposes, it gets installed in the back of the rear distributor housing cover. The picture below shows where this seal is mounted. 19. Install the new seals on the distributor housing and slide the housing onto the end of the camshaft. 20. Install the distributor housing (M6) retaining bolts and torque to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb). 21. Insert the woodruff key into the slot in the camshaft and install the camshaft sprocket and retaining collar. 22. Install the M10 x 65 mm bolt into the retaining collar. For cheesehead bolts torque to 65 - 70 Nm (48 - 52 ft-lb). If you decide to use a hex head bolt, torque to 45 Nm (33 ft-lb). 23. Install the connector into the recess in the retaining collar. 24. Apply loctite to connector retaining bolt (M5 x 10 mm), insert into collar and tighten. Page 9 of 10 25. Verify the crankshaft has remained at TDC (ENG-13) . 26. Align camshaft sprocket to TDC using the scribe mark on the camshaft sprocket and mark on the rear distributor housing. 27. Install the camshaft belt onto the camshaft sprocket. Ensure there is no slack in the portion of the belt going directly from the camshaft sprocket to the gear on the crankshaft. 28. Tension the camshaft belt using ENG-10. 29. Install the timing belt covers. 30. Install the alternator and power steering belts. 31. Install the air flow sensor and air filter housing (AF-01). 32. Reconnect the battery. Rear Cam Housing Gasket Replacement The rear cam housing gasket is not very difficult or time consuming to replace. However, the bolts that hold the rear cover in place can be a bit difficult to get to. I'm not sure why but, Porsche used a cork gasket on the rear cam housing cover. They are notorious for leaking and usually start giving problems shortly after the car has 50,000 miles on it. 1. The rear engine lifting ring is attached to the rear cam housing cover. If the car is equipped with a TDC sensor there will be an electrical connector attached to the rear engine lifting ring. If so, remove the 10 mm bolt that hold the electrical connector retaining strap to the lifting ring and move the connector out of the way. 2. There are three bolts (M6) which hold the lifting ring and rear cover to the cam housing. Using a 10 mm socket or wrench, remove the bolts. 3. Apply a thin coat of bearing grease to both sides of the new gasket (Figure 1, 9). 4. Position the gasket onto the rear cam housing cover and install the cover and lifting ring onto cam housing using the three M6 x 22 mm retaining bolts. 5. Torque the retaining bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb).

Page 1 of 2 8. On cars equipped with spring tensioners (87 Model Onward), perform the following: a. The front plate of the spring tensioner resembles a triangle. Loosen, but do not remove, the locknut and bolt on the side of the triangle near the tensioning spring. b. Remove the tension on the belt by pushing down on the tensioner lever arm. This can be done using a pry bar. However, the tool of choice is the factory balance shaft sprocket pin spanner. The pins on the spanner fit into two holes on the front of the spring tensioner for easy operation of the spring tensioner. With the spring still compressed, tighten the locking bolt and nut. This will allow you to re-install the belt without having to fight the spring tensioner. 9. On cars not equipped with spring tensioners (pre-'87), perform the following: . Loosen the camshaft tensioning roller lock nut and turn the camshaft tensioning roller nut beneath it in the clockwise direction to release the tension on the timing belt. 10. After the tension has been released from the camshaft belt, slide the belt off the camshaft sprocket. The cam belt does not need to be removed unless it is to facilitate work other than just the camshaft assembly removal. 11. If equipped, disconnect the sensor plug retaining strap on the engine lifting bracket at the back of the cam housing (M6 bolt - 10 wrench). 12. Using an 8 mm hex key or Allen head socket remove the plugs from the top of the cam housing. 13. Using a 6 mm Allen head socket and extension or long 6 mm Allen head socket, remove the cam housing retaining bolts (15 - M8 bolts). NOTE Two of the cam housing bolts also act as bracket bolts for the &quot;hard pipe&quot; section of the return line from the heater core. If only the cam housing is to be removed, the return line may remain connected and simply moved out of the way. However, if the head is to be removed as well, the return line should be removed. This will be detailed in the head removal procedure after the coolant system is drained and prior to removing the exhaust manifolds. 14. Remove the cam housing by lifting upward slightly and tilting the cam housing toward the right side of the car. By tilting the assembly you are attempting to keep the lifters in their respective openings in the bottom of the cam housing. This is important if the old lifters are to be reused. If the lifters must be removed, store them in a fashion that they can be identified for correct orientation during installation.

On the 8V 944s, valve timing for both the intake and exhaust valves is accomplished by a single overhead camshaft. The 16V 944s, have two camshafts, one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves. On these cars, the exhaust valve camshaft is driven by a camshaft sprocket directly from the timing belt, identical to the 8V cars. However, the exhaust and intake camshafts have a toothed gear located near the center of the shaft. A chain between the exhaust and intake cam allows the exhaust camshaft to drive the intake camshaft. The drive chain tension is maintained by an oil fed tensioner. Over time, the tensioner will eventually wear out. The tensioner itself seems to be fairly reliable until around 130,000 miles. However, many 16V owners have experienced failures related to other tensioner components a just over 100,000 miles. Most of these failures can be attributed to failures of the J-Tube oil supply pipe or to the plastic guide rails on the tensioner. Until recently, the plastic rails were not available separately. They had to be purchased as part of the tensioner. However, Zim's Autoparts has recently made the tensioner pads available. The web site address to locate the tensioner pads is: https://secure2.advwebsys.com/zimcgi/specials.pl It's a good maintenance practice to inspect the tensioner at 45,000 mile intervals up to 90,000 and at 15,000 mile intervals thereafter. The following procedure describes how to replace the timing chain and tensioner on a 944 S or 944 S2. It was written by Derek Holliday and, although I haven't had the opportunity to use it yet, seems to be very thorough. I've also taken the liberty of providing some part numbers to go along with the procedure. Thanks, Derek. If it turns out you need to replace only the tensioner pads, here a link to a procedure for just replacing the pads: http://boerger.golden-tech.com/images/cam_chain_tensioner_replacement.htm Page 1 of 8 Parts Part Tensioner Timing Chain Oil Supply Tube (J-Tube) Seal Rings (for J-Tube) Cam Housing Gasket Top Tensioner Pad * Bottom Tensioner Pad * Part Number 944 105 049 01 944 105 501 01 944 105 167 03 900 123 115 30 OR N 013 807 09 928 104 447 09 928 105 509 01 928 105 347 01 * Supposedly the tensioner pads can not be purchased separately from the tensioner itself. However, a member of the old Porschefans List noticed that there were part numbers stamped on each of the tensioner pads and provided those part numbers to the list. I've yet to find anyone who's actually ordered just a set of pads and replaced them. Procedure 1. Disconnect the battery negative lead. 2. There are two hoses that run at the back of the cam housing. You'll have to disconnect those two hose to remove the cam cover. Simply disconnect one end of the hoses and use a bungee cord to hold them out of the way. (Tip from Erik Ohrnberger) 3. Remove cam cover. Check inside of cam cover for signs of chain rubbing. Also check cylinder head for signs of chain rubbing. 4. Carefully stuff rags into the oil drain galleries at the lower side of the head, next to the exhaust valves. This will prevent you accidentally dropping anything down the oil ways, particularly when you remove the chain tensioner and oil feed pipe. 5. Inspect chain tensioner and oil feed pipe for signs of wear or cracking. NOTE In my case, the oil pipe had broken off completely. The plastic rubbing block on the chain tensioner had wear grooves in it and a hairline crack in the plastic, so I replaced it. Unfortunately you can only buy the complete tensioner (about $400 equivalent here in the UK) even though it seems that its only the plastic that is a problem. I've heard lots of advice about the plastic breaking up and taking out the chain, cams, and valves with it, so it seems good insurance if there is any doubt about it. Page 2 of 8 6. Remove air filter housing and inlet pipe, up to air flow meter. 7. Remove PAS pump and alternator belts (and a/c if fitted?). 8. Disconnect wire to Hall sensor on rear of exhaust cam sprocket rear cover and move wire clear of plastic covers at front of engine. 9. Remove bolts securing black plastic covers from the front of the engine using a 10mm socket. Remove upper and lower covers. 10. Remove the distributor cap and plug wires. (3 screws). 11. Remove the metal cover over the front of the exhaust cam sprocket. 12. Remove the ignition rotor from the cam sprocket (3 screws). 13. This next stage I only learned about after I had already done the job but it should eliminate the need to re-time the cam on reassembly (assuming that the cam timing is correct before you tear down). Remove the 3 screws from the ignition rotor and refit them to the pulley assembly and tighten. This should lock the pulley onto the three-armed &quot;propeller&quot; which is keyed to the cam and sits behind the pulley. If you don't do this, when you subsequently remove the pulley bolt, the pulley will rotate on the cam and you will lose the cam timing setup. Credit to Kevin Gross for this tip. 14. Remove the fan assembly from the radiator to increase the clearance when working on the cam and balance shaft belts. 15. Set the engine to top dead center by aligning the scribed mark on the cam pulley with the line on the top lip of the metal cover behind the pulley. Check that the crank is at TDC by ensuring the mark on the flywheel is aligned with the pointer. This is visible by looking at the back of the engine on the drivers side (USA). On the clutch bell housing near the top, there is a square hole through which the flywheel can be seen, and also a static pointer. There is a line scribed on the flywheel with the letters &quot;OT&quot; next to it. There is also nearby a circular hole so don't confuse the two. I found it quite difficult to find the correct hole due to lots of cables and pipes in the way. With the crank at TDC, the notches on both balance shaft sprockets should be lined up with the static marks on the plastic cover behind the belts. The static mark for the upper (right hand when looking at the front of the engine) balance shaft sprocket is a notch on the plastic cover at the 12 o'clock position. The static mark for the lower (left hand) balance shaft sprocket is a molded protrusion on the plastic cover, at approximately the 7 o'clock position. 16. With the crank at TDC and the cam pulley mark aligned with its static mark on the rear cover, mark the relationship of the cam and balance shaft belts to their sprockets, and also the direction of belt rotation (the crank pulley rotates clockwise when viewed from the front). I used white paint for this. If you intend to remove the balance shaft pulleys (which is necessary if you need to replace the balance shaft oil seals), then also mark the relationship of the balance shaft pulley covers to the pulleys themselves. Like I said above, this makes more sense if you have the Haynes manual to refer to. Page 3 of 8 17. Loosen the balance shaft tensioner pulley. This is the pulley to the left of the lower balance shaft pulley when viewed from the front. The tensioner pulley has an eccentric hub which is clamped in position with a nut and washer. Once the nut is loose, the belt tension will cause the tensioner to rotate and slacken off the belt. Haynes recommend you mark the position of the tensioner hub before releasing it, so that it can be refitted to the same position afterwards. In my case, the balance shaft belt was so loose that I could not rely on the original tensioner position for correct belt tension. 18. Carefully remove the balance belt from its pulleys/tensioners. 19. Locate the cam belt self tensioner mechanism. This is below and to the left of the upper (right) balance shaft pulley. The mechanism comprises a bracket with a pulley on the left and a spring behind it on the right. You should see three nuts/bolts on it. The bolt on the left attaches the tensioner pulley. The top nut is attached to the tensioner pivot stud. Loosen this with a 13mm wrench or socket. The nut on the right locks the tensioner in position. Loosen this with a 13mm wrench or socket. 20. Push downwards on the tensioner pulley to compress the spring. This will allow the belt to slacken. With the tensioner spring pressure relieved in this way, you can remove the cam belt from the cam pulley. It may help to temporarily tighten the right hand nut on the tensioner to keep it compressed while you remove the belt from the pulley. 21. Remove the tensioner mechanism from the engine. It is secured by three nuts which you can't easily see. One of the nuts requires the removal of an idler pulley located just below the tensioner, using a 17mm socket. 22. With the tensioner removed, you can carefully remove the cam belt. Removal of the crank pulley is not necessary providing you take care to ease the belt clear without kinking or damaging it. 23. Once the cam belt is removed, do not turn the crank or you may damage the valves. 24. This next stage is my own method of ensuring that the cam timing can be restored, before removing the cam pulley. By using Kevin Gross's tip as indicated at stage (10) above, it should be possible to eliminate the need for making any alignment marks in order to restore the cam timing on reassembly. The factory method requires dial gauges to properly set up the cam but I don't have the factory settings so instead I very carefully marked the cam and pulley positions before removing the cam pulley. White paint won't do for this, since you need to be much more precise than paint marks will allow. I used a scriber and scribed marks on the exhaust cam and the adjacent front bridge piece which clamps the front end of both cams onto the head. The marks must line up exactly. Next, I scribed a line across the top face of the cam tooth that has the timing mark on its edge. In effect, my scribe mark was a continuation of the pulley timing mark. I used a 6 inch steel rule to keep the scribed line straight. Next, I placed the 6 inch rule, end on across two cam teeth such that the edge of the rule aligned with my scribed mark and the rule was also in contact with the rear metal pulley cover. This enabled me to also Page 4 of 8 scribe a line on the lip of the pulley cover. It was necessary to make these two marks because the existing timing marks on the pulley and cover were not aligned exactly. Very close, but not perfectly aligned. In any case, removing the belt can move the pulley slightly. I can't emphasis enough how accurate you need to be in scribing these marks, especially on the cam and housing, since the diameter of the cam is much less than the pulley and hence even a 0.5mm misalignment is about 2 degrees of cam rotation. These marks will enable you to align the cam and pulley on reassembly. Next, using a pin spanner in the slotted holes of the pulley to prevent the pulley rotating, undo the pulley bolt using a 10mm spline drive bit (12 point bit). It is fairly tight. Mine needed 75ft/lbs to crack it loose. Remove the pulley bolt and its hexagonal washer. Before I removed the pulley, I also scribed lines on the end of the pulley and camshaft, after first lining up the two sets of lines I had already scribed. This was because the rear metal cover behind the pulley, onto which I had scribed a static mark for lining up the pulley, may not install back in exactly the same position if there is any clearance in its attaching holes and bolts. By scribing marks on the end of the pulley and cam, it allows the alignment of the pulley cover itself to be checked on reassembly before relying on the scribed marks. 25. Pull the pulley off the cam. A puller should not be necessary to do this. If using Kevin Gross's tip as shown at (10) above, you will also pull off the metal shield and the three-armed &quot;propeller&quot; trigger for the hall effect sensor, with the pulley. If not, these need to be removed individually. I did not remove the woodruff key in the cam but take care that it doesn't fall out and get lost. 26. Remove the three bolts and the rear metal pulley cover. 27. Remove the four bolts and the front bridge piece which clamps the ends of both cams to the head. 28. Remove the exhaust cam end seal and the inlet cam end sealing bung. 29. Before removing the chain tensioner and cams, offer up the new cam chain along side the old one. To the left of each chain sprocket on the cams, there should be a cast-in triangular pointer which should be pointing pretty much straight up, with the cams at the crank TDC position. The cam chain should have two copper colored links in it. There are five plain colored links in between the copper ones. These links should align with the tooth on each sprocket which lines up with the triangular pointer on the cam. This is on the top run of the chain as you look at the installed chain and cams. It is this alignment of the chain and sprockets which governs the timing of the inlet cam to the exhaust cam and so it is critical to ensure that this is set up properly when you subsequently fit the new chain and refit the cams. 30. Remove the metal pipe from the chain tensioner and head by unscrewing both banjo bolts. Make sure you also remove the sealing washers, 2 per banjo fitting. In my case, the pipe had broken away. I have heard of pipes cracking, so it's probably good insurance to replace the pipe anyway. Page 5 of 8 31. Prior to removing the tensioner, it is necessary to depress the upper rubbing block against the tensioner spring pressure and to temporarily lock it in position. I did this by first inserting a thin strip of metal between the chain and the plastic, and then inserting two nails into the holes in the metal body of the tensioner, alongside the plastic rubbing block. The use of the metal strip was to reduce the risk of the nails damaging the plastic, since the spring pressure is quite strong. If you intend to replace the tensioner anyway, then this would not be necessary. 32. With the tensioner compressed as above, remove the two bolts which attach the tensioner to the head and remove the tensioner itself. 33. Carefully remove the cam retaining cap bolts using an 8mm spline drive bit (12 point bit). It is very important to ease each bolt out very gradually and evenly, approximately a quarter or half turn each at a time. This is due to some valves being open and their springs putting uneven pressure on the cam. Each cap is numbered 1-8 and there are numbers stamped on the head next to each cap to ensure they go back on in the correct position. Not only should each cap go back on in the same position but its orientation should also be the same, so note the orientation before removing the caps. Take great care not to damage the caps since they are not replaceable and are line bored with the head during manufacture. 34. Carefully lift out both cams together, complete with chain. Take care not to damage the cam bearing surfaces or the cam followers. 35. With the cams removed, chain replacement is simple. Just ensure that the copper links go over the sprocket teeth which align with the triangular pointers on each cam as described above. I compared the free length of old and new chains and couldn't really see much difference at all. However, chains are cheap and so again, it's good insurance. 36. Refitting the cams is the reverse of removal. Make sure the cams are fitted with their triangular pointers in the same place they were prior to removal, and that the chain is correctly fitted with the copper links lined up, before you refit the cam retaining caps. Lube all bearing surfaces before refitting. Make sure the caps go back in exactly the same positions and orientations they were before, and tighten the bolts very carefully and progressively. If you feel any undue resistance with any bolts, then adjust other bolts to even up the orientation of the cam before proceeding. Finally torque the bolts to 15 ft/lbs. 37. Refit the cam end seal (exhaust) and bung (inlet). 38. Refit the bridge over the end of both cams. I used a thin smear of Hylomar sealing compound on the mating surfaces. 39. Refit the cam pulley rear metal cover. 40. Slide the pulley onto the cam. At this stage, don't bother with the &quot;propeller&quot; and metal shield. Check the alignment of the scribed marks made previously. The cam can be rotated slightly if necessary by using the pin spanner on the cam pulley. Once the scribed marks on the cam and adjacent front bridge are aligned perfectly, next ensure the marks on the end of the pulley and the end of the cam are aligned. Then, check that the marks on the pulley tooth and the pulley rear Page 6 of 8 cover are aligned. You may have to loosen the rear cover bolts and move the cover slightly to get the marks lined up. Once all marks align perfectly, you can tighten the pulley rear cover bolts. If you followed Kevin Gross's tip above, then instead of aligning all these marks, you should just need to refit the pulley/metal shield/&quot;propeller&quot; assembly, held together with the three ignition rotor screws. The key way in the &quot;propeller&quot; should ensure that the pulley goes back on in the same position as it was before. However, using this method, you should be careful not to try to rotate the cam by turning the pulley, since I suspect the three small rotor screws may not prevent the pulley from rotating in the elongated slots where the three screws fit. If the pulley does rotate in relation to the &quot;propeller&quot; then, unless you have made &quot;back up&quot; scribed marks, you will need to use the factory timing procedure using dial gauges. 41. Remove the pulley and refit the &quot;propeller&quot; and the thin metal shield, then refit the pulley. Before torquing the pulley bolt (48-52 ft/lbs), make sure all scribed marks align perfectly. Hold the pulley with the pin spanner while tightening the pulley bolt. I had to do this several times because each time I tightened the pulley bolt, the pulley would move slightly. Once the bolt is torqued (I also used Loctite on the bolt), then recheck all scribed marks to make sure everything is back as it was before you pulled it apart. I cannot over stress the importance of getting the cam timing alignment right. If it's not right, then as a minimum, the engine will probably not have optimum torque across the rev range, and worst case is valves and pistons coming together and all the resultant damage. 42. From there on, reassembly is pretty much the reverse of removal. 43. When you install the cam cover bolts, be sure that you don't overtighten them. They should only be torqued to 7 ft-lbs. Page 7 of 8 44. Cam and balance belts should be replaced if they show any signs of wear or damage, and in any event, if they are approaching 45,000 miles. Tensioner and idler rollers should be inspected and if the bearings are worn or rough, they should be replaced. I chose not to replace the water pump but there are plenty of opinions that this should be done if the pump is approaching or past 100k miles. I also replaced both balance shaft front seals, and the &quot;top hat&quot; bushings that slide onto the ends of the shafts. The oil seals seal onto these bushings and in my case, both bushings had wear ridges from the old oil seals. The Haynes manual is quite good in detailing the balance shaft seal replacement procedure. 45. The cam chain tensioner should be inspected very carefully if the original is to be refitted. In my case, the plastic wear block was cracked and there were very noticeable wear grooves so I bit the bullet and changed it. The consensus seems to be that, although there is no change interval specified by Porsche, the tensioner should be changed at about 60k miles. 46. Don't forget to remove the rags used to block of the oil return galleries inside the head! 47. The belts should be refitted with the crank at TDC (the crank should not have been disturbed throughout the procedure!) and the cam sprocket mark aligned with the static mark on the sprocket rear cover. The notches on the balance shafts should be aligned with the static marks on the plastic cover. If the old belts are to be reused, they should be refitted to run in the same direction as they were before removal. 48. Belt tensioning is best performed with the special tool. I did not have access to this and had to rely on the automatic tensioner for the cam belt, and &quot;feel&quot; for the balance belt. 49. After completing the belt installation and adjustment but before starting the engine, it is advisable to turn the engine over slowly through several revolutions by hand with the spark plugs removed. Any hard fouling of pistons and valves should be detected this way and serious damage avoided.

The coil spring for the cover retracting mechanism is broken or the spring has come out of the retracting mechanism plastic end piece. The procedure should help you determine and correct the cause of the retracting mechanism failure. 1. Carefully hand roll the shade into the cargo cover assembly. 2. Remove the whole shade assembly from the back of the rear seat. There are two large screws, one on each end of the shade assembly inside and approximately one inch from each end. 3. Place the assembly on a large table or counter top. 4. On each end of the assembly you will see a plastic end piece cover. Each cover is held in place by pop rivets. Remove the passenger's side end cover by drilling out the pop rivet (you only need to remove one end cover). Be careful not to damage the area of the end cover around the pop rivet during removal. 5. Once the plastic end cap is removed, slide the roller & shade out of the open end of the assembly. 6. With the roller and shade removed, CAREFULLY unroll the shade being careful not the tear it. 7. Looking at the unrolled shade and the roller, you will see that the roller is a hollow silver metal shaft which is slotted along the entire length with white plastic end caps pressed into both ends. 8. You may be able to separate the shade from the shaft by carefully sliding the end of the shade out of the slot of the roller. If you have difficulty sliding the shade out of the shaft, stop and proceed to the next step. You don't want to risk tearing the shade. 9. At each end of the roller there is a white plastic end cap. The caps are pressed into the roller and the metal shaft is dimpled in three places to hold each of the end caps in place. With an electric drill and a bit the same diameter as the dimple, CAREFULLY drill out the dimples. You will drill slightly into the plastic end cap but that's okay. We'll worry about that later. Remove the end cap with the flat tip which is attached to the spring assembly. The spring assembly is hidden inside the metal shaft and is attached to the white plastic end cap. You only need to remove the cap from that end. 10. Now that you have drilled out the dimples, pull out the plastic end piece with the central shaft and large coil spring. The spring and shaft are covered by a brown paper sleeve. Remove the sleeve and set it aside for re assembly. Page 1 of 2 11. If you haven't done so already, slide the shade out of the roller. 12. When you inspect the removed end piece and spring you will see where the end of the spring is or should have been attached to the white plastic end piece. This is the typcial problem area. The end of the spring has probably separated from the white plastic end piece or the end of the spring may be broken. 13. If the end is broken, you will have to re-bend approximately 1/8 inch of the end. You will have to heat the end of the spring and allow it to cool, making an &quot;L&quot; shaped bend to fit into the plastic end piece. 14. Once you have identified and corrected the problem with the assembly, reassemble in reverse order. When you get to the drilled out dimples, simply redimple with a metal punch, next to where you drilled out. When you have reattached the shade to the roller and are about to place back into the assembly, you will need to rewind the spring inside the roller approximately 10-15 revolutions. You can make a little hand crank out of a piece of coat hanger wire. You won't be able to wind it with you fingers. 15. After re-assembling the cargo cover, re-install the assembly using the two large screws that go at either end of the assembly.

Using DME-01, remove the DME Control Unit (and KLR for Turbos). 2. Before removing the control unit(s) from the mounting bracket, pay particular attention to how they are mounted on the bracket. I recommend drawing a picture showing how they are mounted, especially for turbocharged cars where there are two units. Then, remove the control unit(s) from the mounting bracket. 3. Once the control unit(s) are removed, place them on a clean, dry, flat surface. 4. If the air in your work area is particularly dry, or you have a problem with static electricity, you should invest in a grounding strap to attach to your wrist. Static electricity is your worst enemy from here on. 5. Turn the control unit so that the back side of the module is facing up. 6. Using a small flat tip screwdriver, pry up the casing tabs on the rear of module. 7. When all tabs are raised, slide the module cover off. 8. What you will find inside the unit is two printed circuit boards mounted face-toface. Separation between the two circuit boards is maintained by plastic posts. The posts are mounted to the bottom circuit board and the top board clips onto the top of the plastic post via tabs at the top of the post. The post are actually twopiece posts which are split in the middle. The two halves of the post simply snap together. The two circuit boards are connected electrically via a ribbon cable at the end of the board opposite the electrical connector. To replace the appropriate chip the two circuit boards must be separated from each other. 9. To separate the boards, place the tip of a small flat tip screwdriver between the slit at the middle of the post. Pry back and forth gentle until the two halves of the post separate (some posts may have a pin in the center which must be pulled out to allow the posts to separate). 10. Once all the posts are separated, lift the top circuit board up on the side of the board closest to the ribbon cable. Then slide the board toward the ribbon cable side. The will allow you to slide the other edge of the circuit board out of the electrical connector. 11. You should now be able to &quot;open&quot; the circuit boards and lay them out flat. 12. The chip to be replaced should be easily identifiable. On the late model cars (1985.5 and newer), it should be the only chip on the boards that is not soldered in place. Instead, it will be inserted into a socket connector. Page 1 of 2 NOTE Before removing the old chip (Turbocharged cars) make sure you have identified the correct chip for installation. On 1988 model and newer cars this is simplified because the DME control unit uses a 28 pin chip while the KLR Unit uses a 24 pin chip. However, pre-1988 model cars all use a 24 pin chip for both the DME and KLR. For turbocharged cars, it's a good idea to mark the old chips before removal to identify which control unit it came from, just in case you decide to go back to the factory chips in the future. Also, make sure you look at how the chip is oriented in the socket before removal (All cars). There is an indent on one end of the socket and on one end of the chip. If the new chip is not installed such that the indents line up, the chip may be permanently damaged. 13. To remove the old chip, slide a small flat tip screwdriver under one end of the chip an pry up gently. DO NOT try to completely remove the chip by prying up on one end. Move to the other end of the chip, slide the screwdriver under the edge, and pry up gently. Move back and forth between both ends of the chip until the chip comes completely out of the socket. 14. Install the new chip, ensuring that all of the legs on the chip are aligned with their respective holes in the chip socket. Again, make sure the orientation of the chip is correct (indents lined up). Slide the chip into the socket and gently press down on the center of the chip until it is fully seated. 15. Fold the two circuit boards together and slide the top circuit board into the slot on the electrical connector. 16. Make sure that the posts on both circuit boards are aligned and press down gently to snap them together. 17. Install the control unit cover and bend the tabs to hold the cover in place. 18. Mount the control unit(s) to the mounting bracket. 19. Before bolting the control unit(s) into the car, attach the electrical connector (and the hose for the KLR on turbocharged cars). 20. Using DME-01, install the control unit(s) into the car.

I've simply put off writing this procedure for some time. If you need to replace your clock, cigarette lighter, temperature control unit, or light bulb for the clock or cigarette lighter, this is the procedure you need to use. Tools · · · · Stubby Phillips head screwdriver Regular Phillips head screwdriver (optional - may use stubby Phillips for all) Small flat tip screwdriver Small set of needle-nose pliers Temperature Controls Removal 1. Remove the control knobs (4) for the temperature control unit. NOTE Be extremely careful when removing the fan speed control knob. It has a light bulb behind it and it is very easy to break the bulb or the retaining tabs for the stem of the control knob. It may be necessary to slide a small flat tip screwdriver behind the control knob and apply pressure gently while pulling the control knob off the stem. 1 2. Remove the temperature controls cover by carefully sliding a small flat tip screwdriver under each outside edge to loosen the trim piece. 3. Behind the temperature control unit cover you will find four (4) Phillips head screws which hold the unit in place. Remove the screws to slide the control unit out. 4. You'll find an electrical connector plug on the back of the temperature control unit. Disconnect the plug and the TCU should slide right out of the dash. Clock/Cigarette Lighter Removal 2 1. To remove the clock or cigarette lighter or to replace the light bulb for the clock or cigarette lighter, the temperature control unit must be removed up to the point of removing the four Phillips head screws which hold the unit in place. Use the procedure above to loosen the control unit from the dash. 2. Open the passenger's side door (left-hand drive cars) , locate the side trim panel and remove the single Phillips head screw using a stubby Phillips head screwdriver. You will have to slide the panel toward the front of the car slightly to disengage the tabs on the trim piece from the side of the vent. 3. Behind the side trim panel, you will find three (3) Phillips head screws. Remove the bottom screw which holds the trim panel in place. 4. Carefully remove the rectangular trim cover next to the passenger side vent control lever using a small flat tip screwdriver. 3 5. Behind the trim cover you will find two (2) Phillips head screws which must be removed. 6. Remove the temperature sensor intake cover by turning the cover 90° counterclockwise. I used a small set off needle-nose pliers. However, very careful as it's easy to break the vents on the cover. 7. Remove the single Phillips head screw behind the temperature sensor vent cover. NOTE 4 Be careful when you pull on the trim piece for removal. It may be stuck and you'll need to determine why and take appropriate action to keep from breaking the trim piece. 8. Pull out on the right side of the trim piece. Be aware that the trim piece will likely be stuck on the right side vent slider. You'll have to carefully push the head of the slider through the slots on the vent piece to keep from breaking the slots or the slider. Also, the trim piece may be stuck the the upholstery underneath. If it seems to be stuck, slide a putty knife behind the trim piece and pry gently all the way around the edge to loosen it from the upholstery. The left edge of the clock trim panel should now slide out from behind the temperature control unit. 5 Installation 1. Position the clock trim panel (if removed) in place with the left edge behind the temperature control unit. 2. Install the temperature control unit retaining screws (4 Phillips head). 3. Install the temperature control unit cover. Press gently on the outside edges of the cover to engage the retaining clips. 4. Install the temperature control unit control knobs. Be careful when installing the fan speed control knob as it is easy to break the retaining tabs on the stem (which also contains a light bulb). 5. Install the single Phillips head screw in the temperature sensor intake opening and install the round vent cover (insert cover carefully and rotate 90° clockwise). 6. Install the two Phillips head screws beside the passenger's vent control lever and install rectangular trim cover. 7. Install the Phillips head screw in the outside edge of the front trim piece. 8. Install the outside trim cover using a single Phillip's head screw.

If the car is driven hard or is used on the track (Driver's Ed events, Autocross, Time Trials, Full Race) the clutch disc wear should be checked more frequently. I generally recommend every 7500 miles for these cars OR at the end of each race season, whichever comes first. Tools · · · · Metric Socket Set Jack Stands Floor Jack Measuring Device (Ruler) Procedure 1. Place the vehicle on jack stands. 2. Remove the rubber dust cover from the round inspection port (approximately 1&quot; diameter) on the left hand side of the clutch housing. In all likelihood you'll find this cover missing. I don't think I've seen one on any 944 I've ever worked on. 3. Measure the distance from the front end of the inspection port (edge closest to the front of the car) to the edge of the clutch slave cylinder piston. Page 1 of 2 NOTE In this particular picture the end of the slave cylinder and side of the inspection port are difficult to see. That's because this picture was taken on a turbo with the heat shield for the cross-over pipe in place. If the heat shield is removed it's much easier to see the inspection port from above the cross-over pipe. Also, on normally aspirated cars it's much easier to see since there is no cross-over pipe to obstruct your view. 4. If the measured distance is 34 mm or greater the clutch disc should be replaced. The distance for a new clutch should be approximately 18 mm.

Although there is nothing about a clutch replacement that is beyond the capability of most home mechanics, the job is very time consuming and requires a great deal of patience. If you take the car to a professional shop for a clutch replacement, the average labor times for the replacement are as follows: 944 Clutch Labor Times Vehicle 944 944 Turbo 1 944 Turbo 2 1 2 Time (hrs) 16 20 24 Two piece crossover pipe One piece crossover pipe Tools · · · · · · · · · · · · · Metric Socket Set Metric Wrench Set Jack stands Floor jack Clutch alignment tool (944 specific or Metric Universal) 8 mm Cheesehead tool (12 point internal) 12 mm Cheesehead tool (12 point internal) if flywheel is to be replaced or removed for resurfacing Slide hammer bearing puller set Various screwdrivers (Phillips and Straight Tip) 150 mm long, 8 mm thread bolt Pliers (preferably locking) Hammer Molybdenum Disulfide Grease (MoS2) Other Procedures Needed · · · · EXH-01, Exhaust Manifold Removal and Installation TRANS-03, Transaxle Removal and Installation IGN-02, Speed and Reference Sensor Replacement BOLT-01, Allen Head and Cheesehead Bolt Removal Page 1 of 6 Removal 1. Place car on jack stands. 2. Remove belly pan. 3. Remove the exhaust system from the exhaust headers back. On 944 Turbos this means removing the crossover pipe. For early 944 Turbos with a one-piece crossover, the intake manifold must be removed. Refer to EXH-01 for removing applicable portions of the exhaust system. 4. Remove all of the exhaust system hangers from the torque tube. 5. Disconnect the battery positive lead. 6. On top of the clutch housing, cover the timing mark window with a piece of duct tape. This will keep you from inadvertently dropping anything into the clutch housing. 7. Remove the speed and reference sensors (on top of the clutch housing). 8. Disconnect the cable clamp next to the speed and reference sensors (alternator to starter). 9. Disconnect the ground wires (2) on top of the clutch housing (near the speed and reference sensors). 10. Remove the heat shield from the starter (if equipped) and disconnect the starter electrical leads. 11. Some early vehicles will be equipped with a support between the engine and clutch housing (near the bottom of the exhaust headers). If equipped, remove the support. 12. Remove the starter retaining bolts (2) and remove the starter from the car. 13. Disconnect the cable clamp on the side of the clutch housing (above the starter). 14. For turbocharged cars, loosen the clamp on the wastegate diaphragm hose and remove the hose. 15. For turbocharged cars, remove the retaining bolts that hold the wastegate bracket to the torque tube and remove the wastegate from the car. 16. Remove the transaxle using TRANS-03. 17. Remove the fuel filter. 18. Remove the transaxle carrier. 19. Disconnect the clutch slave cylinder from the clutch housing and hang out of the way. 20. Support the engine underneath the oil pan with a jack and a block of wood. The block of wood protects the oil pan from damage. 21. Remove the 4 bolts that attach the torque tube to the clutch housing. 22. Remove the shift lever and shift lever base plate from the torque tube. 23. Slide the torque tube towards the rear of the car. It will be necessary to rotate the torque tube 180° to allow the triangular tabs on the torque tube to clear the torsion bar tube. 24. Remove the clutch release lever retaining bolt from the clutch housing (just above the opening in the clutch housing for the starter). 25. Thread the long 8 mm thread bolt into the end of the release lever pivot shaft. Remove the release lever pivot shaft by holding the 8 mm bolt with a pair of pliers and tapping the pliers with a hammer or prying with a screwdriver. Page 2 of 6 26. Remove the 4 clutch housing retaining bolts (2 at the top of the housing - 2 at the bottom) 27. Remove the clutch housing and release lever. 28. Using the 8 mm cheesehead tool, remove the pressure plate retaining bolts. Wake up the bolts using BOLT-01, make sure the tool is completely seated in the bolt head, and remains seated in the bolt head at a 90° angle while loosening the bolts. The engine will likely try to turn when you attempt to remove the flywheel bolts. Here's several ways to keep it from turning while removing the bolts: a. Use and impact wrench. Personally, I don't like this method. It's too easy to strip the bolts IMHO. b. Install two pressure plate bolts into the flywheel and hold a screwdriver between the two bolts to apply counter-torque while you loosen the flywheel bolts. c. Have someone hold the crankshaft pulley bolt (15/16&quot;) with a socket and ratchet. d. Use the Porsche &quot;engine-out&quot; flywheel lock to hold the flywheel in position while loosening the bolts. e. Clamp the edge of the flywheel using a pair of Vise Grip pliers. 29. Remove the pressure plate, release bearing, and clutch plate. NOTE If the bolt head strips, drill the bolt head off. Personally, I recommend replacing the retaining bolts with new hardware. Also, if the flywheel is to be resurfaced, you should replace the flywheel bolts as well. 30. If the flywheel is to be resurfaced, remove the flywheel retaining bolts using the 12 mm cheesehead tool. Page 3 of 6 NOTE This is an excellent opportunity to replace the rear main oil seal. 31. The next step is to remove the pilot bearing in the end of the crankshaft. Some people elect not to replace the pilot bearing because it can sometimes be difficult to remove. However, they usually end up regretting it later. In my opinion, replacing the pilot bearing is essential. There are three methods of removing the pilot bearing: a. There are several different types of bearing pullers which will work on the pilot bearing. Baum Tool and Automotion (among others) offer a bearing puller specifically for pilot bearings. You can also use a slide hammer puller with a pilot bearing attachment. b. The second method involves inserting a bolt into the bearing opening with a head slightly smaller than the opening. Catch the edge of the bolt head behind the bearing, grasp the other end of the bolt with pliers, and tap on the pliers with a hammer. c. I've had success using this method on other vehicles but, limited success on 944s. Pack the area behind the bearing with grease until it is completely full. Using a wooden dowel slightly smaller than the bearing opening, place the dowel in the hole and hit the end of the dowel sharply with a hammer. If the area is packed solidly with grease, it will force the bearing out. Installation 1. If the pressure plate is to be replaced (recommended), remove the toothed starter ring from the pressure plate. The ring fits tightly on the pressure plate, so a large diameter wood dowel or brass punch and hammer will be needed to tap around the outside edge of the ring to free it. Install the starter ring on the new pressure plate. Ensure the holes in the starter ring line up with the bolt holes in the pressure plate while installing. 2. Install a new release bearing on the pressure plate. You may need the snap ring from the old release bearing if the new bearing does not come with one. Install spacer(s) onto the release bearing. Insert the bearing into the opening on the pressure plate. While holding the bearing in place, lay the pressure plate on a flat surface with the pressure plate friction surface facing up. Press down on the sides of the pressure plate to compress the pressure plate fingers. This will allow enough clearance to install the snap ring onto the release bearing. The number of spacers installed should not prevent the snap ring from being installed. Also, once the bearing is installed and the snap ring is in place, there should be a small amount of movement between the release bearing and the pressure plate. 3. Install the new pilot bearing. Apply a thin coating of MoS2 grease to the inside surface of the bearing (where the end of the drive shaft will insert). Use a socket of the same size of the outer diameter of the bearing and tap into place using and socket extension and hammer. Page 4 of 6 4. Install new needle bearings (2) in the clutch release lever. Apply a small amount of MoS2 grease to the release lever bearings and to the rubbing surfaces of the release lever arms (i.e. at release bearing surfaces and socket for slave cylinder piston). The shop manual calls for a coating of white solid lubricating paste (AOS 126 0006). However, it's my understanding that this paste tends to harden in the bearings and is no longer used. So, use the MoS2 grease instead. 5. Install the flywheel if removed. Torque the flywheel to crankshaft bolts to 90 Nm (65 ft-lb) 6. Replace guide sleeve in the clutch housing if needed or desired. If the guide sleeve is replaced, torque the bolts to 15 Nm (11 ft-lbs). Coat the inside of the guide sleeve (even if you don't replace it) with a light coating of MoS2 grease. 7. Apply a small amount of MoS2 grease to the splines on the inside of the new clutch disc and the splines on the end of the driveshaft. 8. Before installing the clutch components, clean the friction surfaces of the flywheel and pressure plate. Brake cleaner works well in this application. Ensure your hands are clean when handling the pressure plate and clutch disc. 9. Ensure the pin on the flywheel is pointing straight down. 10. Using the clutch alignment tool align the clutch disc to the flywheel. Ensure the tool is inserted fully into the pilot bearing. 11. Install the pressure plate with all bolts partially threaded before final torquing. Tighten the pressure plate bolts a few turns at a time, alternating sides as you tighten the bolts around the circumference of the pressure plate. This ensures the pressure plate is pulled down evenly onto the surface of the flywheel. Torque the pressure plate bolts to 25 Nm (18 ft-lb). 12. Remove clutch alignment tool. 13. Apply a thin coat of MoS2 grease to the inside surface of the guide sleeve on the inside of the clutch housing. 14. Locate the release lever in the clutch housing and install the housing with the clutch lever onto the block. The block has alignment pins to locate the housing onto the block. Install the clutch housing bolts and torque to 75 Nm (54 ft-lb). 15. Position the release lever so that it aligns with the release lever pivot shaft opening in the clutch housing. 16. Slide the pivot shaft into the clutch housing until it is fully seated. 17. Install the pivot shaft retaining screw and torque to 9.5 Nm (7 ft-lb). Tighten locking nut against the clutch housing and torque to 7.5 Nm (6 ft-lb). 18. Push the central tube forward and bolt to the clutch housing. Leave the mounting bolts loose until the transaxle is installed. 19. Install the transaxle carrier. Torque the transaxle carrier to body bolts to 46 Nm (33 ft-lb). 20. Using TRANS-03, install the transaxle. 21. On turbocharged cars, install the wastegate. Do not tighten mounting bracket bolts until the exhaust system is completely installed. 22. Install the clutch slave cylinder. Torque the mounting bolts to 21 Nm (15 ft-lb). 23. Install the starter and attach wiring harness. Torque starter mounting bolts to 45 Nm (32 ft-lb). Install starter heat shield (if equipped). Page 5 of 6 24. Attach the starter wiring harness to clutch housing at two attaching points with sleeve clamps. 25. If equipped with support between the engine casing and clutch housing (early vehicles), install support and torque bolts to 42 Nm (30 ft-lb). 26. Attach ground straps at the top of the clutch housings. Cover access opening in clutch housing with tape to avoid dropping washers into the flywheel. (Note: I found it much easier to do this if I disconnected the heater control valve hose from the engine and held it out of the way.) 27. Install the exhaust system hangers onto the torque tube. 28. Install the sections of the exhaust system removed for the clutch replacement using EXH-01. 29. Install the speed and reference sensors using IGN-02. 30. Attach the two ground wires to the top of the clutch housing (near the speed and reference sensors). 31. Install belly pan. 32. Connect battery.

Terry Jenner did a great job with this procedure. He wrote the procedure, took the pictures, and documented everything in such detail (including where the pictures should go in the procedure) that it made my job of rolling it into a web page extremely simple. I made a few minor editorial additions to account for the differences in clutch pedal assemblies. Thanks to Terry for excellent work on this procedure. There are some differences in the early 944 pedal (1982-89) arrangement and the pedal for the later cars (1990-91 944, 1992-on 968). One notable difference is that they use a different clutch master cylinder (see parts list) and the way the master cylinder push rod assembly attaches to the clutch pedal is slightly different. Below is exploded views of the early and late pedal arrangements. In the procedure that follows I tried to document the exploded view part numbers where appropriate to make things a little easier to follow.

Place the front of the car on ramps or jack stands so you can work under the car and get to the clutch slave cylinder to bleed the clutch once you're done with this project. It also raises the car to a level you can work at without ruining your back. 2. First, you will discover that, unless you remove the seat, you're going to be on your back in a small space until you get a few pieces off. I don't know how large people do this. Have patience. You can do it. 3. At the pedal cluster, there is a plastic cover over the connecting rod between the master cylinder and clutch pedal. I think it was put there to keep large feet from ripping all that wiring out, but it also keeps you from getting the clutch master cylinder disconnected, so you need to remove this cover to get at the connecting rod/spring clip/bushing. 4. Using a 10mm socket, remove the three nylon nuts that hold a plastic cover in place. There are two on the left edge (as viewed from behind the vehicle looking forward) and one on the aft right corner. Page 4 of 12 5. Remove Spring Clip from clutch pedal where the clevis (exploded views 14, 28) connects to the clutch pedal assembly. Simply pull down on the clip with needle nose pliers. Mark with a paint pen where the clevis connects to the clutch master cylinder connecting rod. This rod will need to be adjusted for the proper play when you reinstall the clutch master cylinder. Do not remove the clevis from clutch master cylinder push rod until you've measured the length of the push rod / clevis assembly (detailed in installation section). NOTE On late model 944s and 968s, the spring clip was put there to hold the rather beefy bolt (944-423-387-00) that is mounted transversely on the clutch pedal assembly through the clevis. On early 944 clutch pedals (1982-89), instead of a bolt which holds the clevis, there is a post which is physically part of the pedal assembly (see exploded views). 6. On late 944s and 968s, once the spring clip is removed, push the clevis bolt out through the right side (to your left as you do your gymnastic routine on your back under the steering wheel). The master cylinder push rod / clevis should now be free of the clutch pedal. On early 944s, once the spring clip is removed, you should be able to pull the clevis straight off the post on the clutch pedal assembly. Retain the plastic bushing (common to early and late assemblies). Replace if broken. Put the spring clip, large rod, bushing, and 3 nylon nuts in a ziploc bag. 7. Using rags to protect your paint from corrosive brake fluid, use a turkey baster to remove most of the brake fluid from the brake fluid reservoir. 8. Loosen the hose clamp connecting the blue brake fluid line to the fluid reservoir, and then remove the hose, taking care not to break the plastic where the reservoir connects to the blue hose. Make sure you have plenty of rags under the connections you are removing. You may need to cut the factory hose clamps off with a side cutter and replace them with new stainless clamps available at hardware stores. 9. With a 12-mm flare nut wrench, remove the solid line from the front of the clutch master cylinder. Push the line aside so you can pull the master cylinder out when it's time to do so. Page 5 of 12 10. Using a universal joint type adapter on your socket wrench, remove the two 13mm bolts holding the clutch master cylinder to the firewall. Place a magnet near the socket as you work in order to catch the nut and concave washer. I stuffed rags in the open spaces below the master cylinder to help catch flying parts. 11. If the paper gasket is torn, replace it with new. Take care to ensure that you don't upset the angle pipe at the top of the clutch master cylinder. If it breaks or comes out of the clutch master cylinder body, you will be where I am, which is replacing the cylinder with a new OEM one. Page 6 of 12 12. Using slip-joint pliers, gently pull the clutch master cylinder away from the firewall. Once clear of the studs, pull up at an angle to pull the entire clutch master cylinder, boot, connecting rod and clevis from the firewall. Bag the parts. Page 7 of 12 Installation 1. Remove new clutch master cylinder from box. Remove plastic cap protecting threads on front of master cylinder. NOTE The Porsche 968 manual discusses checking and adjusting the clutch pedal push rod (clevis) length to ensure proper pedal position (this also applies to 1990-91 944 pedal assemblies). However, it is not discussed in the 944 factory manual. Since the 968 clutch pedal and 944 clutch pedal arrangements are different, the push rod lengths are likely different as well (haven't been able to verify that). Therefore, on early 944s before you remove the remove the clevis from the old clutch master cylinder push rod, measure and record the distance from the mounting plate (dog ears) of the master cylinder body to the center of the mounting hole on the clevis. 2. Remove clevis and stop nut from old clutch master cylinder push rod and place on new master cylinder. 3. For early 944s, adjust the length of the push rod to the length measured in the note above and lock in position using the stop nut. 4. For late 944s and 968s, adjust the length of the push rod / clevis assembly (Distance A in the picture below) to the length listed below. Once adjusted, lock the clevis in position using the stop nut. NOTE Distance A below is normally measured from the body of the car to the center of the mounting hole on the clevis after the master cylinder is installed in the car. However, it's much easier to install the clevis and set the length before the master cylinder is installed. Therefore, if you add 3 mm to the lengths listed below (to account for the thickness of the firewall) you can adjust the length of the push rod / clevis assembly prior to installing the master cylinder. Otherwise, it must be done after the master cylinder is installed. Page 8 of 12 A = 147.0 mm for LHD cars A = 109.5 mm for RHD cars 5. Cut 16-18 inches of new blue hose. Attach to clutch master cylinder angle pipe carefully with stainless hose clamp. Do not over-tighten. Install other stainless clamp only tight enough to keep it from falling off as you work. 6. Install new clutch master cylinder with hose attached to firewall gasket. Have a friend guide the rod into place on the clutch pedal so it's not jammed up. Page 9 of 12 Tighten the nuts with the concave washers behind them. I used a universal joint on the socket wrench, but I found a ¼ inch drive socket worked without the universal attachment. Your mileage may vary. 7. Install hard line to front of clutch master cylinder with 12mm-flare nut wrench. Have patience, as there is little room to work here. Page 10 of 12 8. Install blue hose to brake fluid reservoir. Be careful not to over-tighten and break the plastic nipple. 9. Now get back under the dash to install the clevis bolt, plastic bushing and spring clip. When adjusted properly, the clutch master cylinder should have about 1/8 inch of foreplay before it engages. You can adjust this after bleeding the system. 10. Fill brake reservoir to somewhere above minimum (MIN) line. 11. Install empty power bleeder on reservoir. Pressurize to 10-15 psi and check for leaks. Fix any leaks before adding fluid to the power bleeder. 12. After checking for and fixing any leaks, add one quart of fresh brake fluid to power bleeder. Pump up to 15 psi and slide under the car with the catch pan, 7mm wrench, and clear plastic tubing. Page 11 of 12 13. Open the bleed nipple on the clutch master cylinder and watch the flow for air, there should be lots of air in the system. Once the fluid runs solid with no bubbles, close the bleed nipple and detach hose and wrench from nipple. Clean up where spills may have occurred. 14. Remove any rags you may have stuffed in the area of the clutch master cylinder. 15. Test the clutch. It should have plenty of resistance and spring back. 16. Remove the car from the ramps/jack stands and test drive.

The difficult part of the job is bleeding the slave cylinder. This procedure will describe the slave cylinder replacement and provide some tips that will hopefully save you some time. Tools · · · · · Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Bucket Rags DOT 4 Brake Fluid Other Procedures Needed · ELECT-02, Starter Removal and Installation Procedure 1. Using ELECT-02, remove the starter. 2. Remove the two retaining bolts that hold the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. 3. Slide the slave cylinder out of the clutch housing. 4. Have the new slave cylinder ready to install and a bucket / rags ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. 5. Disconnect the fluid supply line from the old slave cylinder and connect it to the new slave cylinder. NOTE There are several methods of bleeding the slave cylinder. One is done prior to installing the slave cylinder into the clutch housing and can be done by one person. The other is the more common method of bleeding the slave cylinder. It is done after the slave cylinder is installed in the clutch housing and requires an assistant. Page 1 of 3 NOTE Regardless of which method of bleeding the slave cylinder you choose, it is always important to ensure that the master cylinder reservoir remains full. This is especially true when bleeding the slave cylinder as its supply line taps off of a high point on the master cylinder. Check the master cylinder reservoir level frequently during the bleeding procedure. 6. Bleed the slave cylinder using one of the following methods: Bleeding Method 1 a. Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. b. With the slave cylinder not yet installed in the clutch housing, raise the end of the slave cylinder with the bleed nipple as high as possible. c. Open the bleed nipple and use the slave cylinder operating shaft as a pump to bleed the slave cylinder. Have some rags and a bucket ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. d. When bubbles stop coming out, close the bleed nipple. e. Install the slave cylinder in the clutch housing using the two retaining bolts. Bleeding Method 2 a. Install the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. b. Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. c. Have an assistant depress the clutch pedal and hold it to the floor. d. Open the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder. Have a bucket and rags ready to catch any brake fluid that spills. When fluid / air stops coming out, close the bleed nipple. e. Have the assistant release the clutch pedal. The first few times the slave cylinder is vented, the clutch pedal with have to be pulled off the floor. f. Repeat steps c, d, and e until clutch pedal operation feels normal. Page 2 of 3 Bleeding Method 3 a. Install the slave cylinder into the clutch housing. b. Raise the rear of the vehicle as high as possible above the front of the vehicle. c. Have an assistant depress the clutch pedal. It should stay on the floor. d. Connect a mityvac (hand vacuum pump) to the bleed nipple on the slave cylinder. Open the bleed nipple and draw brake fluid from the slave cylinder using the vacuum pump until the fluid flows clear with no air bubbles. Ensure that the brake reservoir remains full during the bleeding. e. Close the slave cylinder bleed nipple. f. Slowly pull the clutch pedal off the floor. This will draw fluid into the master cylinder. Check the brake fluid reservoir for proper level. g. Repeat Step &quot;b&quot; to remove any additional air. h. At this point the clutch pedal should operate normally. Pump the clutch pedal a few times to see if it feels spongy. If it does repeat Step &quot;b&quot; as necessary. i. Using ELECT-02, install the starter.

They have been a source of heartache for many 944 owners. The basic problem with the alloy control arms is that the ball joint rides inside a nylon cup or sleeve which is inserted into the aluminum housing of the control arm. That in itself is not a huge problem. However, due to the geometry of the control arm, spindle, and ball joint housing orientation a preload is created (for lack of a better term) which forces the ball joint against the side of the nylon cup under normal loading. This results in premature wear of the nylon cup which eventually allows the ball joint pin to contact the aluminum housing. This results in wear to the housing and ball joint pin. Over time, the pin develops cracks and finally shears completely. This problem is more prevalent in cars which are driven extremely hard (i.e. hard cornering, auto-cross, or tracked cars). It becomes and even bigger problem when the control arm geometry is changed on cars with lowered front suspensions. The logical solution would be to change ball joints more frequently. However, ball joints on alloy control arms were not, until recently, easily replaceable. In fact, early on, there were no replacement parts available to rebuild the alloy control arms. The only solution was to replace the control arms with new ones from Porsche. The new control arms from Porsche do come with a two year warranty. However, they're also brutally expensive. Fortunately, there are a number of companies who now offer a rebuilding service for the alloy control arms. Most of these companies offer a two or three year warranty. And, for those who are adept at doing their own repairs, parts are available for you to rebuild the control arm yourself. In addition to rebuild options, there are also aftermarket control arms available which have easily replaceable ball joints. However, these tend to run any where from $900 1600 USD. We will discuss their availability later. While this page deals primarily with the later alloy control arms, we will also look at upgrade control arm options for the early 944 control arms. Page 1 of 6 Rebuilding Services Below is a list of companies who rebuild 944 alloy control arms. Each has different policies regarding warranty and core charges. Before deciding on a rebuilder, contact each to determine their policy and current pricing. Control Arm Rebuilders Vendor Blaszak Precision Motorsports Contact Info 4835 Holmes Rd.

The first company we'll talk about is KLA Industries, Inc. They offer bushing kits to replace the original factory bushings. The bushings are made of nylon similar to the original equipment bushings. The KLA kit does not include new ball joints. According to KLA, it's not typical for the control arm ball joints to be damaged even in cases where the bushings are extremely worn. The KLA kit currently runs $74.95. Contact information for KLA Industries can be obtained from their web site: KLA Industries, Inc. (http://www.klaindustries.net) Page 4 of 6 Another kit is available from SSI Auto, Inc. SSI Auto's kit includes bronze bushings instead of nylon bushings. It also comes with chrome-moly ball joints. The SSI kit runs $175 and is a good replacement choice for cars that are frequently driven hard. Contact information for SSI is listed below: SSI Auto 1735 E. Joppa Rd Baltimore, MD 21234 (410) 668-1100 Web Site - http://www.ssiauto.com Procedure This procedure is based on a procedure originally written by 951 RacerX. It has been modified to use the same format used on this web site. The original procedure, with pictures, can be found on the 951 RacerX website. Also, the author is working on a new procedure for replacing the ball joints without removing the control arm from the vehicle. 1. Using SUSP-07, remove the control arms from the vehicle. 2. You may have to remove epoxy material from the control arm to expose the bottom of the control arm ball joint. Specifically, you'll need to be able to get to the circlip that holds th ball joint in the arm. 3. Remove the rubber grease boot from the control arm. Keep the boot retaining spring. 4. Place a large socket over the pin side of the ball joint and a nut or small socket against the bottom cover of the ball joint. 5. Squeeze the assembly in a vise enough to allow the circlip in the bottom of the ball joint to be removed. 6. Use a small screwdriver to pry the circlip out of the groove in the control arm. 7. Remove the assembly from the vise and disassemble ball joint assembly. 8. If you're using a kit that only replaces the ball joint bushings (i.e. ball joint is reused), inspect the ball joint carefully for cracks in the pin or unusual wear. If the ball joint is cracked, it should be replaced. 9. Place the top ball joint bushing into the opening in the control arm. Make sure it is aligned evenly in the opening. 10. Press the ball joint bushing into the control arm using a vise and a socket or seal driver that is slightly smaller than the opening in the bottom of the control arm (the opening is slightly larger than 30mm). Place a piece of wood between the back side of the control arm and the vise to prevent damage to the arm. 11. Apply a good CV joint grease to the cup and to the control arm ball. 12. Insert the ball into the cup followed by the lower cup, spacer ring, spring, another spacer, and cover plate. 13. Squeeze the assembly in the vise and install the circlip. 14. Apply epoxy to the bottom of the ball joint opening to keep the circlip in place. 15. Using SUSP-07, reinstall the control arm.

Early 944s are equipped with steel control arms which use replaceable ball joints. The big question that most owners have about control arm ball joints is &quot;how do I know when my ball joints need replacing?&quot; Most often you'll hear it said that if the boot is torn or cracked, the control arm needs to be replaced. While this isn't a great indicator, it should raise suspicion as to the condition of the ball joint. Other indicators are knocking sounds in the front suspension or noticeable play in the control arm. The play can be checked by pushing up on the control arm (toward the spindle) near the ball joint. Noticeable play between the control arm and the ball joint indicates that the control arm needs to be replaced. Another question that often comes up is &quot;do I have to replace the control arm if I accidentally tear the boot on the ball joint?&quot; No. If you're convinced that the ball joint is still good and you've simply torn the boot on the ball joint, there is a solution. You can replace the boot with the boot from an early 944 ball joint. It's not a perfect solution but, $20 USD for an early ball joint beats having to buy a new control arm or having it rebuilt. Now for the big question. &quot;Do I use a new control arm or a rebuilt control arm?&quot; The answer to this question is not quite as clear as it used to be. Several years ago, the price of a new control arm from Porsche was completely outrageous. So, most folks were using rebuilt arms. In recent years, Porsche has reduced the prices on many of their parts, including control arms, to be more competitive with after market suppliers. Porsche has also increased the warranty on most of their parts from one year to two years. However, the price of rebuilt control arms is still generally less than new control arms and at least one rebuilder offers a three year warranty. Rebuilt control arms can be purchased from Dynamic European Technologies, Zims, and Tweeks among others.

Disconnect the front sway bar from the body and the control arm and remove the sway bar from the car. 5. Mark the orientation of the eccentric bolt to the control arm for proper alignment during reassembly. I normally use brightly colored finger nail polish. The eccentric bolt attaches the rear of the control arm to the body of the car. 6. Remove the nut and bolt that attaches the spindle to the ball joint. 7. If the rear eccentric bolt bushing is to be replaced, remove the lock nut at the rear that attaches the eccentric to the bushing. 8. Remove the lock nut at the front of the eccentric bolt. 9. Remove the two bolts that attach the eccentric bolt bushing to the body. 10. Remove the bolt and nut that attaches the front of the control arm to the cross member. 11. Using the rubber hammer, tap on the top of the control arm to free the ball joint from the spindle and remove the control arm from the car. Installation 1. If the eccentric bolt assembly was removed from the car perform the following: a. Transfer the eccentric bolt orientation mark from the old control to the new control arm. b. Attach the eccentric bolt to the control arm making sure it is aligned with the scribe mark transferred from the old control arm. c. Torque the eccentric bolt lock nut to 100 Nm (74 ft-lb). NOTE All lock nuts should be replaced with new hardware. 2. Position the control arm in the car and install the control arm to cross-member bolt. 3. Slide the eccentric bushing onto the eccentric bolt. Bolt the bushing to the body with two bolts and loosely install the rear eccentric lock nut. 4. Fit the ball joint shaft into the spindle assembly. Ensure the ball joint shaft is fully inserted into the spindle. 5. Install the ball joint to spindle bolt and lock nut. Torque to 50 Nm (37 ft-lb.). 6. Place jack under ball joint with a block of wood on the jack pad. Raise the jack until it just supports the weight of the car. 7.

With the engine shutdown, if the temperature in the discharge cooling line from the turbocharger rises to 115 °C (as sensed by a temperature sensor), the electric turbocharger cooling pump comes on to circulate coolant from the expansion tank, through the turbocharger, and back to the expansion tank. The turbocharger cooling pump also comes on for 25 seconds any time the engine is shut off regardless of the temperature in the discharge line. When the engine is running, a turbo thermostat opens at 82 °C. The water pump then draws coolant from the expansion tank through the non-running turbo cooling pump and through the turbocharger bearing housing.

Due to the location of the drain in close proximity to the bottom radiator cross-member, coolant tends to drain into the lower cross-member, filling it up, and drains out holes at various locations along the bottom of the cross-member. That means you can get coolant draining from several locations under the radiator making it almost impossible to drain the system without making a huge mess. This is further complicated on turbo models where the aerodynamic ground effects extend back from the front of the car directly underneath the radiator. To prevent these draining problems, I usually cut a piece of plastic from an old anti-freeze container or gallon milk jug that is about six inches long and several inches wide (wider if you have a turbo and the ground effects are still under the nose). Fold the ends up on the plastic to channel the coolant and then tape the piece of plastic directly underneath the radiator drain plug using duct tape. The idea is direct the coolant out from the plug toward your drain pan without letting it drip into the cross-member. This isn't a perfect solution as there isn't a lot of room between the bottom of the drain and the crossmember. Just tape it up there and hope for the best. 1. If the belly pans have not been removed, use the 10mm socket and ratchet to remove the belly pan bolts. A Phillips head screwdriver will also be required on some cars. 2. Install a device similar to the one described above under the drain plug. Otherwise, be prepared with drain pans (3 should do it) at several locations along the bottom of the radiator. Looking toward the front of the car, the drain plug is at the lower left hand corner of the radiator. It's normally blue in color but, may be discolored with age. 3. Place a drain pain under the radiator and be prepared with rags to catch any coolant which misses the pan. By the way, in case you didn't already know, keep children and pets away from anti-freeze. It is toxic. That's the other reason you want to clean up spills promptly. 4. Remove the cap from the coolant expansion tank. 5. Using the flat tip screwdriver, remove the radiator drain plug. If the drain plug is badly discolored, it's probably very old and should be replaced. Anti-freeze tend to make them very brittle over time and they tend to break off when you're trying to reinstall the plug. If it does break off in the hole, you can usually get it out with a small flat tip screwdriver. Page 1 of 4 6. Draining using the drain plug at the bottom of the radiator does NOT completely drain the cooling system. There will still be coolant left in the block in the area around the cylinders. Some maintenance may require draining the cooling system completely. For example, if the coolant an oil have mixed, it is desireable to drain the block completely as well to minimize the number of flushes required to remove all of the oil from the cooling system. If you need to drain the cooling system completely, there is a drain plug on the passenger's side of the block (LHD cars).

Filling the Coolant System Porsche recommends using a phosphate free anti-freeze in the aluminum engines used on 944s. Standard glycol type anti-freeze which contains phosphates will cause minerals to plate out on the heat transfer surfaces inside the engine. I've read that it isn't really isn't necessary to use phosphate free anti-freeze in the United States because most water systems have a very low mineral content. However, this doesn't take into account those who have private wells. I figure better safe than sorry. Phosphate free anti-freeze used to Page 2 of 4 be a little hard to find. However, it's becoming much easier to find now days. I personally prefer Prestone Extended Life because you can buy it almost anywhere and it's not that expensive relative to other anti-freeze brands. Be suspicious of anti-freeze that says, &quot;Safe for Aluminum Engines&quot; on the label. Unless it specifically says &quot;Phosphate Free&quot; on the label, it probably isn't. Usually a 50-50 anti-freeze and water mixture is good for most climates. However, if you live in an extremely hot or extremely cold climate, check the manufacturer's label for mixing instructions. Venting the Coolant System Tools · · 12mm socket and ratchet with extension. Coolant system pressure tester (Method 1) 1. The coolant system vents best if it is at ambient temperature. 2. Turn the ignition key on and turn the heater control to full heat (i.e. fully clockwise). 3. Crack open the coolant system high point vent. This is a 12mm bolt located on the coolant nozzle at the front of the cylinder head. It will be near the #1 plug. On the Turbo models the bolt is on the side of the nozzle. On NA models it is on the top of the nozzle. 4. Place some catch rags around the vent. 5. At this point there are three different methods to initiate the venting. I will only describe two of them here. The third involves performing &quot;mouth-to-mouth&quot; on the coolant reservoir. Due to the toxic nature of anti-freeze, I don't recommend it and will not describe it's use. NOTE If you have completely drained the cooling system (using the drain plug on the side of the block) or have had trouble in the past venting the cooling system, you may want to disconnect the upper radiator hose (at the radiator), hold it up in the air, and fill the block by pouring coolant into the hose. It's best if you open the vent at the outlet of the cylinder head so you can tell when the block is full. Do not fill the coolant hose completely as it will make a huge mess when you reconnect it to the radiator. When a good stream of coolant issues from the vent, stop filling and reconnect the radiator hose. Then continue to fill using one of the preferred methods below. Page 3 of 4 Method 1 (Pressure Tester - Preferred) a. Fill the coolant reservoir to between the minimum and maximum marks. b. Obtain a coolant system pressure tester and attach it to the coolant reservoir. If you don't have a tester, many of the better auto parts stores will loan you one. c. Pressurize the coolant system slowly until a steady stream of coolant comes out of the vent. Do not exceed 10 psi pressure. d. Close the vent. Method 2 (Gravity Fill) e. Raise the front of the car on jack stands or ramps. f. With the high point vent cracked open, slowly fill the coolant reservoir. g. When the reservoir level is at or slightly above the maximum mark, coolant should start to come out the high point vent. h. Continue to fill until a steady stream of coolant comes out the vent. i. Close the high point vent. j. The disadvantage to this method is that it is not as effective as Method 1. Also, when venting is complete, there may be more coolant in the reservoir than the system needs. Consequently, the reservoir will overflow due to coolant expansion the first time the car is driven after the vent. NOTE Since the thermostat is not going to be open when you initially fill the coolant system, the flow path for filling the block is via back flow from the upper radiator hose into the head and the block. This isn't a very efficient flow path for filling and may leave some voids in the head/block area. Therefore, it may be necessary to run the engine until the thermostat opens to flush any voids in the system to the high point (vent). 6. After the venting is complete, start the car and run it until it reaches normal operating temperature. Place the temperature control for max heat as this will open the heater control valve and flush the heater core of any voids. After running the engine at temperature, vent the system again.

This is probably due in part to the fact that some of the drawings floating around are of poor quality and difficult to read. Others are just plain incorrect. Even the factory drawings are difficult to read and understand at times. Because of the poor quality drawings out there, some people don't realize that there is a difference in fan operation between the early (pre-1985.5) and later 944s - at least according to the factory electrical drawings and my own experience. The descriptions of cooling fan operation contained in this procedure are based on the factory electrical diagrams, the troubleshooting experience of other 944 owners, and my own experience. Pre-1985.5 944s with Air Conditioning On early 944s equipped with air conditioning, there are two electric cooling fans. The driver's side cooling fan is supplied via a parallel circuit. One leg of the parallel circuit has a resistor which causes the fan to run in slow speed. The other leg of the parallel circuit consists of a contact in the cooling fan relay. The passenger's side fan is supplied via a contact in the cooling fan relay. When the coolant temperature reaches a preset value (normally 92 °C or 198 °F), the temperature switch (normally referred to as the thermofan switch) closes and cause the driver's side fan to run. We'll refer to it as the primary fan. Since the resistor in series with the fan is still in the circuit at this point, the fan runs in slow speed. The fan will run as long the temperature remains above the setpoint, regardless of whether the ignition is turned on. This is a common problem area which will be discussed later. When the ignition is on and the air conditioning is turned on, the air conditioning relay picks up. This causes the cooling fan relay to energize, closing two contacts. One contact causes the secondary cooling fan to run. The other is a contact that is in parallel with the &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor for the primary fan motor. This shorts out the resistor and causes the primary fan to run in fast speed. The second fan has no &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor so when it starts, it always runs in fast speed. Also, when the air conditioning is turned on (with the ignition on), the primary fan will run regardless of coolant temperature. When the ignition is turned on, if a high temperature condition is sensed by the thermofan switch, a contact closes in the thermofan switch circuit which energizes the cooling fan relay and causes both fans to run in fast speed. Page 1 of 12 For a diagram of the early cooling fan circuit (with air conditioning) click here. Below is a troubleshooting guide for the early 944 cooling fan circuit. The troubleshooting guides in this procedure assume (in most cases) that a single failure is causing the malfunction. While multiple failures can occur, it would be nearly impossible to develop a guide to cover all possible combinations of failures. Cooling Fan Troubleshooting Guide Early 944s with Air Conditioning Symptom Driver's side fan runs continuously. (Ignition OFF) Possible Causes Most likely cause is a bad thermofan switch. Testing / Repair Disconnect electrical connector for thermofan switch. If fan stops, the thermofan switch is most likely bad. Some folks will tell you that a bad cooling fan relay can also cause this. However, with the ignition off, the thermofan switch and relay would both have to fail to cause the problem. Disconnect electrical connector for the thermofan switch. If fans stop, thermofan switch is bad. Remove air conditioning relay. If fans stop, AC relay is most likely bad. Auxiliary Fuse Panel: Fuse 3 - Driver's Side Cooling Fan Fuse 5 - Passenger's Side Cooling Fan Disconnect electrical connector at fan and take resistance readings on fan motor. An infinite resistance or ground indicates that the motor is bad. Realize that it is highly unlikely for both fan motors to go bad at the same time. Both fans run continuously. (Ignition ON) Bad thermofan switch. Bad air conditioning relay. One or both fans will not run. Bad fuse or fuses. Bad fan motor. Page 2 of 12 Cooling Fan Troubleshooting Guide Early 944s with Air Conditioning Symptom Possible Causes Bad cooling fan relay. Testing / Repair With a bad cooling fan relay, the driver's side cooling fan should still run in slow speed on high coolant temperature. See procedure for testing the cooling fan relay. A bad air conditioning relay will only keep the fans from running when the ignition is on and the air conditioning is turned on. Both fans should still in high run in fast speed if the ignition is on and a high coolant temperature exists (i.e. thermofan switch contact is closed). See procedure for testing air conditioning relay. Bad air conditioning relay. Bad slow speed fan resistor. Locate the slow speed fan resistors on the firewall behind the tachometer and take resistance readings across the resistors. The resistance should be less than 1 ohm. If the fan(s) will not run at all, you'll likely see an infinite resistance. If the fan is simply running very slowly you may see some resistance that is higher than 1 ohm. Realize that it is highly unlikely for both fan resistors to go bad at the same time.

Testing the Early Thermofan Switch Tools · · Thermometer (which goes to at least 200 °F) Multimeter Procedure 1. Connect a Multimeter across the contacts on the thermofan switch. The thermofan switch contacts should be open (i.e. infinite resistance on Multimeter). 2. Suspend the thermofan switch in a pan of water and heat the water on a stove. Insert the thermometer into the water to monitor water temperature. 3. When the water temperature reaches 198° F, the contact in the thermofan switch should close (i.e. zero resistance reading on the Multimeter). Pre-1985.5 944s without Air Conditioning Early 944s without air conditioning were equipped with a single radiator cooling fan as opposed to two fans. The single cooling fan is supplied by a parallel circuit. Like the cars with AC, if a high coolant temperature exists with the ignition off, the contact in the thermofan switch closes and causes the cooling fan to run in slow speed (via the resistor in the parallel circuit). When the ignition is turned on the cooling fan relay is energized, closing a contact to short out the slow speed resistor. If the high temperature condition still exists (i.e. thermofan switch closed), the cooling fan will run in fast speed.

Late Model 944s The cooling fan operation on late model 944s is similar to that of early 944s. However, there are some distinct differences. The late model 944s use a &quot;slow speed&quot; resistor similar to the early cars. However, on later cars, there are two resistors, one for each of the fan motors. As with the early cars, the thermofan switch (at 92 °C) will complete the fan circuit, even if the ignition is not on. However, unlike the early cars when the fan circuit is completed, both fans run instead of just the driver's side fan. Also, on the later cars the thermofan switch is a dual element temperature switch with one contact closing at 92 °C for slow speed operation and one closing at 102 °C for high speed operation (slow speed resistor bypassed). The fans will operate is slow speed regardless of ignition switch position. However, fast speed operation is only available with the ignition switch on.

The most frequent problems include failing to engage, failing to maintain speed, and picking up a set amount of speed after engagement (typically 5-10 mph). The good news is that most cruise control problems can be solved without high dollar repairs (provided you do the repairs yourself). The two major components in the cruise control system are the cruise control computer and the cruise control servo unit. The cruise control computer is located in the driver's footwell (LHD) above the hood release lever. The cruise control servo is mounted on the firewall in the engine bay just in front of the battery tray. A number of cruise control problems can be caused by either the cruise control computer or the cruise control servo unit. If you are having problems and you aren't sure which unit is causing the problem, I recommend cleaning the cruise control servo first, reinstall the servo and test the system, and evaluate if further repairs are necessary. Refer to the table below to help determine which unit may be causing your problem.

Disconnect the servo electrical connector. 3. Remove the servo from the vehicle. NOTE It's a good idea to make a drawing of the servo as you disassemble it for future reference when you get ready to reassemble. 4. Remove the operating lever arm from the servo. There is a nut holding the lever arm to the servo. 5. Using a Phillips screwdriver, carefully remove the cover from the servo (small spring inside may want to pop out). A small flat tip screwdriver may be used to pry the cover off if it is stuck. 6. Inside the servo, you'll find a circuit board with two conducting strips which are contacted by a wiper arm. The most common problem with the servo is that these strips get dirty and need to be cleaned. 7. Using the spray contact cleaner and a cotton swab, carefully clean the conducting strips on the circuit board. Be careful not to rub the strips to hard as you may damage them. 8. Check the motion of the wiper arm to make sure it is making good contact with the circuit board. 9. Apply grease to the moving parts inside the servo. Ensure no grease gets on the conducting strips or wiper arm. 10. Reassemble the servo, install, and test for proper operation.

Sometimes you'll find it as part of a set of three 12 point tools (8mm, 10mm, 12mm) as they are used in a number of GM applications. However, if the store has the set of three, they should also be able to get them individually as well. Bear in mind before you pass on the set of three that the all three sizes are used in various applications on the 944. The 8mm tool is also used on the pressure plate to flywheel bolts. The 10mm is used on the Camshaft sprocket bolt. And, the 12mm is used on the flywheel to crankshaft bolts. These tools are also known as &quot;cheesehead&quot; tools and if you get them from Snap-On, it's a &quot;triple square&quot; tool. The Lisle tools have the 12 point on one end and a hex head on the other end, so they have to be inserted into a socket to be used. They are also relatively inexpensive (around $8 USD each). The Snap-On tool is significantly more expensive (around $25 USD) . However, the quality is better, they have a lifetime warranty, and the 12 point is mounted in a socket. · · · · · · · · · Metric socket set Channel lock pliers External snap ring pliers Paint marker or bright colored nail polish Punch Hammer Solvent (Mineral Spirits or Brake Cleaner) CV Joint grease (Moly based) Rags Procedure 1. Place the rear of the vehicle on jack stands and place blocks in front of and behind the front tires. 2. Using the paint marker or nail polish, mark the orientation of the drive axles before removal. 3. Using the 8mm 12 point internal tool, remove the cheesehead bolts holding the axles to the transaxle and to the wheel hub. Page 2 of 4 NOTE It will be necessary to hold the wheel while loosening the CV Joint bolts. If the car is low enough, you may place a block underneath the wheel. Otherwise you'll have to hold the wheel yourself, or have an assistant hold the wheel, or lock the wheel by using the parking brake or placing the transaxle in gear while loosening the bolts. 4. When all bolts are removed, carefully lower the drive axle from the vehicle and place on a clean working surface. 5. Use a punch and hammer to tap gently around the outside edge of the CV Joint to separate the collar from the CV Joint housing. 6. Wipe al the grease away from the end of the CV Joint. Using a paint marker or nail polish, mark the end of the CV Joint from the center shaft across all components to the outside edge. 7. Using the external snap ring pliers, remove the circlip at the end of the drive axle shaft. 8. Push the shaft out of the end of the CV Joint. If the shaft is difficult to push out, tap on the end of the shaft with a flat tip punch and hammer to loosen it. 9. Remove the concave washer from the axle shaft. It may be necessary to use the Channel Lock pliers to remove it from the shaft. 10. Slide the boot off the end of the drive axle shaft. 11. Turn the inner race until the balls align with the grooves in the outer race. Then tilt the inner race to separate the inner race from the outer race. 12. Push the ball bearings out of the inner race. NOTE When disassembling the CV Joints, be sure to keep the parts from each CV Joint together. Don't mix them with the parts from other CV Joints. 13. Clean all of the CV Joints parts (races, splines, and ball bearings) with solvent and inspect for damage. If any of the parts show signs of excess wear or cracking, the entire CV Joint must be replaced. 14. Apply a small amount of grease to the ball bearing grooves on the inner race. Using your fingers, press the ball bearings back into the inner race until they snap into place. 15. Assemble the inner and outer races by aligning the ball bearings with the grooves in the inner race and tilt the inner race into the outer race. 16. Inspect the CV Joint boot for rips, tears, or wear and replace if necessary. Apply a small amount of grease or silicon spray to the axle shaft opening in the boot. Slide the boot onto the axle. Place a small amount of grease on the inside of the boot. 17. Slide the concave washer onto the splines of the axle. Use a hammer and deep socket to tap the washer down all the way to the bottom of the splines. 18. Thoroughly repack the CV Joint with grease. 19. Apply a small amount of grease to the axle splines. Page 3 of 4 20. Check the align marks on the end of the axle shaft and on the CV Joint inner and outer races. Slide the CV Joint onto the axle making sure all of the marks are aligned. 21. Install the circlip on the end of the axle shaft to lock the CV Joint into place. 22. Tap the CV Joint boot collar into place on the CV Joint. 23. Reinstall the axle into the vehicle. 24. If any of the heads on the cheesehead bolts were damaged during removal, replace with new hardware. Install all of the bolts on both ends of the axle finger tight first. 25. Using the 8mm 12 point internal tool and a torque wrench, torque the cheesehead bolt to 30 ft-lbs (42 Nm). It will be necessary to somehow lock the rear wheel while torquing the bolts. 26.

Ensure that the mating surface on the cylinder head and block are clean. Remove all old gasket material and deposits. Be careful if using a scraper as it can easily gouge the aluminum surfaces of the head and block. Minor scratches can be remove with emery cloth or steel wool. Deep gouges will require machining to keep the mating surfaces level. In the case of the block this could require removing the engine from the car and removing the head studs. 2. Place the new head gasket on the block.. NOTE (from Tim Richards) I've never tried it personally but, Tim Richards suggests removing the cylinder head with the exhaust manifolds still attached. According to Tim, it saves a couple hours of work. The cylinder head can also be installed with the exhaust manifolds attached. Thanks for the suggestion Tim. 3.

NOTE (from Tim Richards) I've never tried it personally but, Tim Richards suggests removing the cylinder head with the exhaust manifolds still attached. According to Tim, it saves a couple hours of work. The cylinder head can also be installed with the exhaust manifolds attached. Thanks for the suggestion Tim. Recently, a Garage Shop Manual user reported that he was unable to remove the head using Tim's method described above. So, if you decide to try it and it doesn't work, don't be surprised. Also, in talking to a Porsche mechanic friend of mine, he claims that the exhaust headers can be removed without removing the exhaust manifold studs. However, you first have to remove the center exhaust header (2-3) first. Then the outer header (1-4) should come out without having to remove the exhaust header (manifold) studs. If neither of these methods work, you'll have to remove the exhaust manifolds by removing the studs as described below. Page 1 of 2 7. Remove the exhaust manifolds as follows: a. Disconnect the header where it ties in to the remainder of the exhaust system. b. Remove the manifold mounting studs at the exhaust ports on the cylinder head. This can be done by loosening the retaining nut slightly and installing a second nut onto the stud to act as a &quot;jam nut&quot;. While holding the inside nut with a wrench, tighten the outside nut firmly against the inside nut. Then, using the wrench on the inside nut, turn counterclockwise to back the stud out of the head. The other method is to remove the retaining nut from the stud and use a stud extractor to back the stud out of the head. Unless you plan to replace all the exhaust manifold studs, you will need to use an extractor which does not damage the threads on the stud. These can be difficult to find and are sometimes only available as part of a set of extractors making them more expensive. NOTE The exhaust manifold studs are M8 threads which normally use a retaining nut that is 13 mm on the flats. However, there are M8 copper nuts available that 12 mm on the flats, are less susceptible to corrosion, easier to get a socket on to remove, and make excellent jam nuts. Because they are smaller on the flats, when used as the outside nut or jam nut, it will be possible to get a 13 mm socket over the jam nut and onto the 13 mm nut on the inside. Not all exhaust stud bolt are accessible with a socket but, this method simplifies removal for the ones that are accessible. Personally, I use the copper nuts all the time because of their corrosion resistance. If I need to remove the exhaust manifold studs, I remove the M8 copper nuts, install the factory M8 nuts (13 mm flats) on the inside, and then re-install the copper nuts on the outside as jam nuts. c. When the exhaust manifold studs have been removed, remove the exhaust manifolds from the car. 8. Disconnect the coolant hose at the front of the cylinder head. 9. Disconnect the hose at the back of the cylinder head going to the heater control valve. 10. Using a 6 mm Allen head socket, remove the two Allen head bolts at the front of the cylinder head. 11. Remove the cylinder head retaining nuts. Start at the middle of the head working out to the front and rear of the head. 12. Lift up the cylinder head to remove. Tabs at the front and rear of the head are provided as leverage points. Use a pry bar to break the head free.

On the back of the trim panel disconnect the wires for the clock, cigarette lighter, and hazard switch. Be extremely careful when disconnecting plugs as the retaining clips are plastic and break very easily. 6. Remove the center console as follows: . Remove the ash tray from the console. Open the lid on the ash tray stick your fingers down inside and pull straight up. It will pull right out of the console. a. Remove the two Phillips head screws at the front of the ash tray opening. b. Remove the storage pocket from underneath the radio. This is done by forcing both hands inside the pocket pressing your hands out sideways while you pull the pocket out of the dash. Page 12 of 18 c. Remove the two Phillips head screws at the bottom of the pocket opening. d. Lift up on the console insert that surrounds the gear shift lever. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. e. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switches which must be released to disconnect the electrical connector. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you angrier than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily. Page 13 of 18 f. If your console has a front-to-rear fader knob for the radio, it will likely be wired so that it can not easily be disconnected and removed with the console insert. If that it the case, you'll have to push the fader out of the insert and leave it in the car. g. Once you've disconnected the plugs from all of the console switches, remove the spring clip from the gear shift knob and slide the knob off of the shift lever. Set the knob and console insert aside. h. Remove the trim ring from around the radio (if your radio has one), slide the radio out of the console, disconnect the plugs from the back of the radio, and remove the radio from the car. i. Remove the four Phillips head screws that hold the cassette holder insert in place. Two are located at the back of the ash tray opening. The other two are located at the back of the cassette holder insert. Remove the cassette holder insert from the console. j. Remove the two screws at the front of the console, one on either side below the main part of the dash. Remove these two screws and you should be able to slide the entire center console toward the rear of the car to remove it. k. Remove the two brackets which hold the dash to either side of the torque tube tunnel. The front of the center console attaches to these brackets. Page 14 of 18 7. Remove the glove box as follows: . Open the glove box door and remove all of the glove box retaining screws. There are several screws in the front and on the sides of the glove box and two near the glove box light. There's also a clamp at the back of the glove box. a. Crawl under the dash and disconnect the hose going into the back of the glove box. b. You should now be able to slide the glove box out of the dash. You may have to pull down on the top-front of the box to get it to clear the light. c. As soon as you can reach the glove box light wires, disconnect the wires. d. If the car is equipped with air bags, reach into the area above where the glove box was removed and disconnect the two red electrical plugs from the back of the passenger's side air bag. Then remove the four Allen head bolts that hold the air bag in the dash and remove the air bag from the car. 8. Remove the sun visors by remove the three Phillips head screws that hold the pivot end of the visor to the roof panel. Also remove the sunroof visor clips (2 Phillip head screws). 9. Remove the A-pillar trim as follows: . There are three screws for each A-pillar trim pieces. Each will probably have a plastic cover over the screw hole. a. Remove the cover plastic covers for the screws. b. Remove the two bottom screws (Phillips head) for the trim piece. c. The top screw can be a little difficult to figure out. The natural tendency is to stick the screwdriver into the hole at a 90° angle to the surface of the trim piece. However, to remove the top screw, sit in the car's seat and insert the screwdriver (Phillips head) straight up toward the top of the roof into the hole. You'll have to dig around with the screwdriver to get the tip to engage into the screw. d. Once all of the trim piece screws are removed, pull back the weatherstripping that holds the A-pillar trim to the edge of the door frame. Page 15 of 18 e. You should now be able to remove the A-pillar trim piece. The roof panel overlaps the top of the trim piece so; you may have to pull down on the roof panel slight to get the A-pillar trim piece to come out. 10. Remove the steering column trim and switch assembly as follows: . Remove the three Phillips head screws for the turn signal trim and remove the trim piece. a. Remove the rubber trim piece which surrounds the ignition switch. Slide a small flat tip screwdriver under the edge of the trim and pry gently to dislodge it from the opening. b. Remove the two Phillips head screws for the ignition switch trim, remove the trim piece, and disconnect the wires. c. Remove the headlight knob by pulling it gently straight away from the dash. d. To the left of the fog light switch there is an oblong plastic cover with a small notch in one of the short sides (usually the top) of the cover. Insert a small flat tip screwdriver into the notch and gently pry on the cover to remove it from the trim piece. e. Behind this cover, remove the two Phillips head screws. f. With the driver's door open, remove the triangular shaped trim piece on the side of the dash (1 Phillips head screw). g. Under the triangular shaped trim piece, you'll find two Phillips head screws which hold the dash trim piece. Remove those screws. h. Remove the two Phillips head screws that hold the vent and remove the vent. i. Remove the trim piece screw just to the left of the steering column and one on the bottom of the dash. j. Remove the nut that holds the headlight switch in the dash and slide the headlight switch out of the back of trim piece (reach behind the dash). k. You should now remove the trim piece to the left of the steering column. As you remove the trim, disconnect the wires from the fog light switch. l. Remove the switch assembly from the steering column. The assembly is held in place by a collar bolted to the steering column. Remove the bolt and collar and slide the switch assembly off of the column. Disconnect the switch assembly plug as you slide it off of the column. 11. Remove the dash as follows: . Remove the dash upper mounting screws, one at each A-pillar. a. Remove the dash lower mounting screws, one on each side at the bottom of the dash at the outside of each footwell. b. Make sure all wires are clear of the dash and remove the dash by pulling it straight back toward the seats. You'll have to remove the side vent ductwork as you pull the dash away from the firewall. Page 16 of 18 Dash Installation 1. While you have the dash out of the car, check all of the wiring and components normally hidden behind the dash to make sure they're in good condition. 2. Install the upper side vents into the new dash. 3. Maneuver the new dash into position against the felt ledge next to the firewall and install the top mounting screws at the A-pillar. 4. Reconnect the ventilation ductwork to the side vents. 5. Install the dash lower mounting screws at the bottom outside of the dash. 6.

Tools · · Multimeter Spade Connector Jumper Procedure 1. Turn on the ignition and the defroster switch. 2. Using the voltage measuring function on the Multimeter, connect the negative lead to a ground point on the car and use the positive lead to check for voltage on both sides of the grid. You should measure +12 VDC on the left side of the grid and 0 VDC on the right side. 3. On the right side of the grid, you should be able to measure 0 resistance from the grid to ground using the ohmmeter function of the Multimeter. 4. If you read 0 VDC on both sides of the grid, there may be a bad connection on the 12 VDC side (left) of the grid. If you read 12 VDC on both sides, the grid's ground connection (right) may probably bad. 5. If the readings did not check properly, check the electrical connectors on either side of the grid to make sure they are making good contact. 6. If you did not read +12 VDC on the left side of the grid, another possible cause is a bad fuse or bad defroster relay. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), the defroster is powered via Fuse #4 (25A) on the Auxiliary Fuse Panel (under dash driver's side LHD). On later 944s, the defroster is powered from Fuse #13 (30A) on the Central Electric Panel (under hood). 7. If it is suspected that the relay may be the cause of the problem, perform the following: a. Remove the relay from the relay panel. b. Turn the ignition switch ON. c. On the relay panel, jumper defroster relay contacts 30 and 87. Check for proper operation of the defroster.

Why? Probably because it seems like such a simple job and often isn't. Once you realize exactly how the distributor cap is attached and employ a simple tip, the job becomes a lot easier. Tools · · 1/8&quot; or 3mm Hex Key Distributor Cap Tool * *The Porsche Manual has you make a distributor cap tool by bending a flat tip screwdriver into a 90° angle. This allows you to access the bottom locking screw on the distributor cap. I've always had better success with a long thin blade flat tip screwdriver. It must be inserted at angle with the blade resting against the lip of the nose panel (use a towel to protect the paint). However, it allows you more leverage when pushing the locking screw in against its spring pressure. The best screwdriver I've found for this is a Snap-On SDD1416. It has a 16 inch blade with a .028 x 7/32&quot; tip. This screwdriver is also great for hard to reach hose clamps. The MATCO equivalent is an SCM818P2. I have not been able to find a Craftsman equivalent. Procedure The 944 distributor cap is held in place by 90° locking screws. The 90° tip on the screws lock into raised tabs on the inside of the front distributor housing cover. Here's the problem. The elongated openings in the housing cover are offset to one side. That means that both tips on the screws must be pointed in the same direction to clear the openings. The second problem is with the locking tabs. The tabs are shaped like a &quot;U&quot; . The locking screws are pushed in an turned until they come to rest in the bend of the &quot;U&quot;. However, one leg of the &quot;U&quot; is longer than the other to act as a mechanical stop. This means that the screw can only be turned in one direction to unlock and can only be inserted into the locking tabs when the screw is turned in the opposite direction. Now that you're thoroughly confused, I'll try and simplify it. Page 1 of 3 Removing the Distributor Cap 1. Using paint or fingernail polish, mark the bottom half of the top locking screw and the top half of the bottom screw. 2. Using a flat tip screwdriver, push in on the bottom locking screw and turn in the clockwise direction 270°. When you're done, the painted half of the screw head will be pointed to the exhaust manifold side of the car. 3. Then push in the top locking screw and turn in the clockwise direction 90°. Again, the painted half of the screw head will be pointed toward the exhaust manifold side of the car. 4. The cap should slide off easily. Installing the Distributor Cap 1. Holding the distributor cap in the orientation that it is normally installed (i.e. one locking screw on top, one on bottom). 2. Turn the screws until the 90° tips are pointed to the left (looking at the front of the cap). 3. Using paint or fingernail polish, paint the left half of the screw head (side closest to the tip of the screw). 4. Install the distributor cap. The screw tips should slide easily into the elongated holes in the housing with the cap centered over the rotor. 5. Using a flat tip screwdriver, turn the bottom locking screw 270° counterclockwise. The painted half of the screw head will be point up or toward the center of the cap. 6. Turn the top locking screw 90° counter-clockwise. The painted half of the screw will be pointed down or toward the center of the cap. 7. Connect the spark plug wires to the distributor cap. Removing the Rotor 1. To remove the rotor, you'll need a 1/8&quot; or 3 mm hex key. Try the 1/8&quot; first and if that's too big, next try the 3 mm. If it's the original screw and you try the 3 mm first, you'll likely strip the head on the screw. The original screws are slightly larger than 3 mm and they are loctited from the factory. I can't begin to tell you how many of those I've seen stripped using a 3 mm hex key. Anyway, if the 1/8&quot; doesn't fit and the 3 mm does, it's probably been replaced in the past (because it was stripped). 2. Once you've removed the retaining screw, the rotor may be extremely difficult to remove. It sometimes bonds itself to extension on the end of the camshaft. Try twisting it off. However, be aware that you may have to break the rotor to get it off. The rotor material is made of Bakelite and is very brittle. The rotor has a metal sleeve inside which can be twisted off the end of the camshaft extension with a pair of channel lock pliers if you break the rotor. Page 2 of 3 Installing the Rotor 1. Slide the rotor onto the end of the camshaft extension. 2. Insert the Allen head retaining screw into the rotor and tighten (1/8&quot; or 3 mm hex key). Be careful not to drop the screw into the distributor housing cover while installing.

The fuel pump relay on the early cars is located on the fuse / relay panel under the dash on the driver's side (LHD). The DME relay actually has two relays / contacts. The primary relay and contact provide power to the DME (and on turbocharged cars the KLR) control unit. It also provides power to actuate the secondary relay. The secondary relay provides power to the fuel pump (and heater for the O2 sensor). If either relay / contact fails, the car will not start. The DME relays are prone to failure over time. This is primarily due to broken solder joints inside the relay. Often, the relay can be repaired by resoldering the broken solder joint without having to replace the relay. Another cause of failures is a diode in the flow path for the primary relay. The diode is replaceable and can be obtained at most electronic parts supply stores (i.e. Radio Shack). Symptoms of a failing DME relay may appear in several ways. Early on, the car may not start or be difficult to start when the engine has been shut down and restart is attempted while the engine is still warm (actually while the DME relay is still warm). When this happens, the car will normally restart when it is allowed to sit and cool for a period of time (usually from 30 minutes up to 2 hours). Another possible failure mode is for the car to suddenly die while driving down the road. Again, the car will often restart after it is allowed to cool. If your car will not start and you suspect the DME relay may be bad, try tapping on the DME relay and then attempt to restart the car. You might also have an assistant tap on the relay while you attempt to start the car. This will often temporarily fix the DME relay to get the car started. If you experience a DME relay failure and you can not immediately get a new relay, you can get the car home by removing the relay and jumpering the relay terminals on the relay / fuse panel to supply power to the DME and fuel pump. DO NOT leave the jumpers installed when the car is not running. This will cause the DME computer to be continuously energized and the fuel pump to run continuously which will drain the battery. Jumper fabrication and installation will be covered later in this procedure. As a matter of practice, there are certain things I carry with me on the road in case of emergencies. In addition to a full array of spare fuses, jumper cables, ATF, a quart of oil, and a universal tool kit, I also carry spare accessory belts and a spare DME relay (actually a used relay which I repaired). Since most people don't have a spare DME relay lying around, I recommend carrying an emergency jumper.

If a multimeter is unavailable, the Emergency Repairs section below can be used to test the DME relay. 2. On the relay / fuse panel under the hood, remove the DME relay (G5). Page 2 of 6 DME Relay Location 3. Using the multimeter set to read resistance / ohms, take resistance readings across the following relay terminals (labeled on the bottom of the relay): o 30 and 87b o 30 and 87 The resistance across both sets of relays should be infinite. On a digital multimeter, this will normally be indicated by a &quot;1.&quot; or &quot;OL&quot;. 4. Connect a 12 VDC power supply across terminals 85b and 87 of the relay. Using the multimeter, take a resistance reading across terminals 30 and 87b. The resistance reading should be very close to zero (actually between 0.1 and 0.3 ohms). Page 3 of 6 DME Test 5. Connect a 12 VDC power supply across terminals 85 and 86 of the relay. Because of the diode in the circuit, you must connect the negative lead to terminal 85 and the positive lead to terminal 86. Otherwise, the relay will not pick up. Using the multimeter, take a resistance reading across terminals 30 and 87. The resistance reading should be very close to zero (again between 0.1 and 0.3 ohms). 6. If any of the readings taken above are bad, the DME relay should be replaced or if possible repaired. Emergency Repairs 1. If you suspect the DME relay is bad and you need to move the car, you may install do so by installing an &quot;emergency&quot; jumper across terminals 30, 87, and 87b on the relay / fuse panel. Some folks will tell you to jumper terminals 86, 87, and 87b instead. This allows you to only run the fuel pump, DME, and injectors when the ignition switch is turned on. Seems like a great idea on the surface. However, realize that the wire supplying power from the ignition switch to terminal 86 on the DME relay is a 1.0 mm wire and is only intended to carry enough current to pickup the primary coil on the relay. The wire connected to terminal 30 is a 4.0 mm wire which is designed to carry full current demanded by the fuel pump, DME, and fuel injectors. I strongly recommend using terminal 30 instead of terminal 86 to supply power via the jumper. 2. The emergency jumper consists of three leads with male spade connector on each lead (shown below). Emergency Jumper Page 4 of 6 3. To start the car using the emergency jumper, install the jumper in the following sequence: a. Install one spade connector into terminal 87. b. Install the second spade connector into terminal 87b. c. Install the last spade connector into terminal 30. When the connector is installed into terminal 30 you should hear the fuel pump energize. The car can then be started using the ignition switch. 4. Jumpering these terminals and starting the car may also be used as an indirect method of testing the DME relay if a multimeter is unavailable. In other words, if the car will not start and you suspect the DME relay, install the emergency jumper and attempt to start the car. If it starts normally, it's very likely that the DME relay is bad. 5. Again, when the car is not running, be sure to REMOVE the jumpers. Inspecting / Repairing the DME Relay 1. Remove the cover for the DME relay. Looking at the bottom of the relay, you'll see to tabs that hold the plastic cover onto the bottom of the relay. Pull outward on the bottom lip of the cover and pull upward on the terminals on that side until the bottom of the relay is clear of the tab. Repeat for the other side and the cover will come off of the relay. 2. Carefully inspect all solder joints inside the relay for cracks. Back of DME Relay 3. Repair any cracked solder joints. It is often difficult to tell a bad solder joint. And, since I've never really been impressed with the soldering work on any of the DME relays I've seen, I usually resolder all the joints. 4. As a precaution, I normally replace the diode for the primary relay as well. Page 5 of 6 Front of DME Relay 5. After relay is repaired, install cover and test relay using testing procedure listed above.

Some procedures will have you remove the door panel. Others will have you remove the door panel and the door latch mechanism. The factory service manual has you remove the door panel, window, and rear window track. Admittedly, the factory procedure makes replacing the door handle a snap. However, it requires a lot of time consuming removal which may not be necessary. Finally, there are procedures that describe removing the door handle externally without removing the door panel, window, or latch mechanism. Having never done a door handle before, I did not know for sure if this would work. Since I planned to replace my door handles with 968 door handles, I decided I'd remove and reinstall my door handle just to see if it could be all be done external to the door. Apparently, the confusion over the different procedures stems from the difference between vehicles with electric door locks and those which do not. If you have a vehicle with electric door locks, the door panel must be removed to disconnect the wiring going to the door handle. Otherwise, the door handle can be removed and installed completed external to the door. However, this does require a bit of dexterity and great deal of patience. A door latch that is difficult to operate can be caused by several things. It can be a result of a misadjusted linkage between the door handle and the latch mechanism. It can also be caused by a mispositioned striker plate. We will discuss adjustment of both of these during this procedure. Procedures 1.0 - Door Handle Removal 2.0 - Door Handle Adjustment 3.0 - Striker Plate Adjustment 4.0 - Door Handle Installation 1.0 - Door Handle Removal Tools · · · Phillips head screwdriver Long thin blade flat tip screwdriver Flashlight Page 1 of 7 Procedure 1. Remove the Phillips head screw just above the door latch mechanism (see picture). 2. From the outside slide the door handle toward the front of the car to disengage it from the door and then pull outward away from the door. Page 2 of 7 3. On the back side of the door handle you'll see a white plastic piece which is attached to a button on the door handle lock mechanism. Using a flat tip screwdriver, gently pry the white plastic piece off of the door handle. 4. Next, you see the linkage rod running from the door handle down to the latch mechanism. On the end of the linkage rod, there is a plastic socket which attaches to a ball on the door latch mechanism. Slide the long flat tip screwdriver down between the linkage rod and the door latch. By prying gently with the screwdriver and rocking the door handle back and forth the socket will slide off the ball of the latch mechanism. The door handle can now be completely removed from the vehicle. The picture below shows the ball on the door latch with the handle completely removed. Page 3 of 7 NOTE With the door handle removed the socket (shown by red arrow) which attaches to the ball on the door latch and the button (shown by the blue arrow) to which the white plastic locking device attaches can be easily seen. 2.0 - Door Handle Adjustment If you are installing a new door handle the linkage may need to be adjusted to work properly. If you have a problem where the door latch will not operate using the exterior door handle, but will operate using the interior door handle, that means that the linkage from the exterior door handle is probably out of adjustment. To operate the latch mechanism, the door handle linkage pushes downward on the lever arm of latch mechanism. If the linkage is too short, it will not push down far enough to operate the latch. If you are having the problem described above, remove the door handle and inspect the linkage including the socket at the end of the linkage. Operate the door handle with it removed from the vehicle to make sure the linkage moves downward when the handle is pulled. If everything is intact and appears to be functioning properly, the linkage may be out of adjustment. Page 4 of 7 To lengthen the linkage on the door handle, turn the plastic socket (shown by the red arrow below) at the end of the linkage rod counter-clockwise. This will made the entire linkage longer. 3.0 - Striker Plate Adjustment Tools · 5 mm Allen head socket or Allen head key A door handle that is difficult to operate may be the result of a misadjusted striker plate. When the door is closed the latch mechanism should be very close to center on the striker bar as the door is closing. You should be able to see this using a flashlight with the latch just touching the striker bar (door not fully closed). To adjust the plate, loosen all three Allen head bolts and move the striker to the new position and then tighten the bolts. The striker plate adjustment is a much more delicate operation than it seems on the surface. Very small changes in striker plate position made a big difference in how the door mechanism operates. So, you may have to adjust the plate numerous times to find the ideal position. Page 5 of 7 4.0 - Door Handle Installation Tools · · · Phillips head screwdriver Long thin blade flat tip screwdriver Flashlight Procedure 1. During the door handle removal, the white plastic piece which was attached to the button on the door handle lock mechanism may have fallen so that is pointed straight down toward the bottom of the door. Before you can install the door handle the white plastic piece must be oriented so that it is point up. In other words, it should be visible in the larger door handle opening (see picture). 2. Make sure that the rear door handle gasket is installed onto the handle prior to attempting installation. 3. Insert the door handle linkage into the door handle opening. It will probably be necessary to turn the handle at an angle to get the linkage rod to fit into the opening in the door (see picture). Page 6 of 7 4. Align the socket on the door handle linkage with the ball on the latch mechanism. Place the tip of a flat tip screwdriver against the back of the socket and apply pressure while rocking the door handle back and forth. The socket should slide on to the ball. The thin blade screwdriver may flex too much to apply sufficient pressure. You may have to use a flat tip screwdriver with a thicker blade to press the socket onto the ball. 5. Next, insert the door handle far enough into the door opening to press the white plastic piece onto the button of the door handle lock mechanism. You may be able to do this with your finger or it may require pressing on with a flat tip screwdriver. 6. Install the small door handle gasket onto the front of the door handle. Insert the front of the door handle into the opening in the door. Then press on the back of the door handle to seat it in the rear opening. 7. Slide the door handle toward the rear of the car until it stops. 8. Install the Phillips head screw that holds the door handle in place (above the latch mechanism).

Door panel removal tool (shown below) Other Procedures Needed NONE Procedure 1. Near the top of the door panel (front and rear), you'll find two Phillips head screws. The screws are located behind plastic covers. Using a small probe or small flat tip screwdriver, pry off the plastic cover. Then, using a Phillips head screwdriver remove the screws. (See pictures below) Page 1 of 5 2. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the speaker grill from the door panel. 3. If the vehicle is equipped with manual windows, remove the window crank handles. 4. Remove the Phillips head screws along the bottom edge and at the front of the door pocket. When the screws are removed, you'll be able to slide the pocket downward to remove it from the vehicle. Page 2 of 5 5. When the door pocket is removed, you'll find a plastic mounting block at the front of the door panel for the front door pocket screw. Using a Phillips screwdriver, remove the plastic mounting block. 6. Pull out on the interior door handle as if you were opening the door. Behind the handle you'll find a Phillips head screw which must be removed. This is a rather awkward operation and caution should be used to prevent damaging the door handle. Page 3 of 5 7. Using a Phillips head screwdriver, remove the three screws underneath the door arm rest. These screws are threaded into the door at approximately a 45° angle. 8. Along the back rear corner of the door panel, there are several plastic push plugs mounted to the back of the door panel. Loosen those from the door by lifting up on the back edge of the door panel and prying the plugs loose using the door panel tool. Use of the door panel tool is not mandatory. This can be done with a flat tip screwdriver. However, the door panel tool helps prevent damaging the plugs or ripping them out of the back of the door panel. 9. All of the door panel retaining hardware has now been removed. The door panel is held in place (actually hung on the door) by a tab on the back of the panel which insert into a slot in the door. To remove lift up on the panel until the tab slides out of the slot in the door and the panel is clear of the lock button at the top of the door. Page 4 of 5 10. If the vehicle is equipped with electric windows, disconnect the electrical connector plug(s) for the window switch. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the plugs. There are two plastic locking tabs at both the top and bottom of the switch which are very easy to break. I've found that the best method for removing these is to slide a small flat tip screwdriver underneath both tabs on one side of the plug. Then lift up on the screwdriver enough to disengage the tabs and pull back on that side of the plug enough to keep the tabs disengaged. Then move to the other side and repeat. 11. Installation is the reverse of removal.

The bottom line is there is no single best way to modify a 951. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many different aftermarket performance parts suppliers out there. Each car is a special case and modifications should be tailored to each individual's needs, desires, and pocket book. The best advise I can give you is to decide very early on what you want to do with the car. In other words, ask yourself exactly how much performance you want out of the car. But remember, as you approach the physical limits of the car's capabilities, performance modifications will become exponentially more expensive. As a Porsche mechanic friend of mine told me early on, &quot;Speed Costs, How Fast Do You Want To Go?&quot; Next, I'll tell you that although it costs a lot of money to achieve an ultra-high performance 951, you don' t have to be rich to get there (although it does help). However, it will take you longer to get there and it requires a great deal of careful planning, timely purchases, and most of all, a great deal of patience on your part. Heck, I started modifying my 944 Turbo as soon as I bought it in 1993 and have been modifying it constantly since then. When will it end for me? Well, as long as there is new stuff available to try, the aftermarket parts vendors will probably continue to have their claws deep in my wallet. But, for me it's an addiction. I remember a quote from Robin Williams some years ago which went, &quot;Cocaine is God's way of telling you that you're making too much money.&quot; 944 Turbos are MY cocaine. Page 1 of 14 With regards to saving money doing performance modifications, the best way to save money is to learn to do some or all of your own work. This in itself can become costly when you start buying tools - especially some of the specialty tools. However, if you plan to keep the car, the investment in a good set of tools will pay for itself over the long haul. Hopefully, the Shop Manual portion of this web site will help you learn to do some of your own maintenance, modifications, and repairs. I had done work on some of mine own cars up until I bought my 951 in January of 1993. I started doing some of mine own maintenance then but, never really started doing all my own maintenance until early 1996 when I moved to south Jersey. I struck up a friendship with a mechanic there (Chuck Oliver), and under his tutelage, learned to work on Porsches, Ferraris, Mercedes Benz, and others. To this day, Chuck is one of the few people other than myself that I would trust to work on my car. I'd also help him hide a body if he asked. In this particular discussion, we will deal only with engine performance modifications. Suspension and brake modifications will be discussed in other procedures. For the most part, I will stay away from making recommendations about specific products. What I will do at the end of this procedure is provide a list of various performance parts suppliers and some of the things they offer. Then, it will be up to you to decide what is the best course of action for your particular needs. Now that I've bored you to tears with all of the preliminary stuff, let's get down to business. Computer Chips You absolutely can not buy horsepower for a 944 Turbo cheaper than investing in a set of computer chips. For a little more than $500 USD, you can install a set of chips in your DME and KLR and pickup as much as 60 HP. They really make a huge difference in the performance of a stock 944 Turbo. So, how do the chips achieve these horsepower gains? Well, most of them function in essentially the same fashion. 944 Turbos run a maximum stock boost of around 11 psi with an overboost protection set somewhere above that (don't remember exactly where). Aftermarket chips will raise or in some cases eliminate the overboost protection set point and will raise the maximum boost pressure allowed by the boost control system (typically to around 14-15 psi). In addition to the setpoint increase for the boost control system, some setups may come with a device to retard the pressure build up from the turbocharger discharge to the wastegate. Typically, you'll see this in the form of an orifice in the sensing line from the turbocharger discharge to the cycling valve (which controls the wastegate) or by use of a bleeder valve in the line from the cycling valve to the wastegate. For a complete description of how the 951 boost control system works, refer to the 951 FAQ. Also, within the chip set, the fuel and ignition maps are typically modified to match the engines demands at the new higher boost levels. The advantage of using chips is, as we said before, that they are relatively inexpensive for the amount of horsepower gained. They are also relatively easy to install and are well within the capabilities of most shade tree mechanics with a limited number of tools. So, what are the disadvantages? Page 2 of 14 First, for the chips to work to maximum advantage they have to be matched to the system you're running. If you're starting out with a completely stock 944 Turbo, that's not a problem. However, if you install a set of chips and then down the road decide to make other modifications (i.e. different turbocharger), your chips are no longer matched to your system. So, now you have to try and get another set of chips which are matched to your new setup or you have to pay someone to custom map you a set of chips. That can become costly in a big hurry. In theory, you could have a set of chips custom mapped for any setup you decide to use. However, the costs in dyno time along would quickly make such a practice prohibitive. If don't plan to do a lot of performance modifications, a set of chips is definitely the way to go. However, if you think you're going to want other modifications down the road, chips are a waste of money because you'll eventually end up throwing them away. In that case, you're better of saving up your money for a fuel management or stand alone engine management system. Air Flow Measurement Accurate air flow measurement is the single most important variable in any engine management system. The stock air flow meter is a &quot;barn door&quot; type air flow measurement where a door or gate inside the units swings open to various positions based on the amount of air flow through the sensor. These also use a temperature sensor for density compensation of the air flow signal. Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensors use a heated wire element. As air flow increases across the wire it cools changing the resistance of the wire. The measured resistance of the wire can be directly correlated to a specific amount of air flow across the wire. MAF systems may or may not use an inlet air temperature sensor for density compensation. Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensors measure the pressure in the intake manifold. It is then density compensated by a signal from an inlet air temperature sensor to determine the amount of air flow into the intake manifold. The use of MAP sensors is a fairly recent addition to the 944 performance market and are primarily being used with stand alone engine management systems. The great advantage for both MAF and MAP sensors is that they typically provide a more accurate measurement of air flow than a barn door meter and they also eliminate a huge restriction in the air flow path coming into the intake manifold. MAF and MAP systems may be controlled via a special set of chips for the stock engine management computer. Or, they may be used in conjunction with a fuel management or stand alone engine management system to control the signals going to the fuel injectors. MAF and MAP systems will typically run in the range of $1200-2200 range depending on whether they use chips or a fuel management system. Page 3 of 14 Fuel Management Systems The main advantage to a fuel control system is that you can make modifications to your car without having to worry about buying another set of chips or getting chips custom mapped. Most of the fuel management systems out there are &quot;piggyback&quot; systems which means that they tap into the existing engine management so that you can manipulate the pulse signals going to the fuel injectors. These are typically used in conjunction with an Air/Fuel ratio meter which you monitor for proper A/F mixtures as you tune the system. Fuel management systems will typically have some type of control module which can be programmed via dials on the front of the unit or using a laptop computer to manipulate the fuel maps on the chip inside the module. The system may operate with the stock air flow meter, or it may require the installation of a Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor, or even a Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor. Fuel management systems are generally fairly easy to install and setup. However, they do have limitations with regards to the level of control you have over the signals sent to the injectors and they do not offer any control over ignition timing. And, control over ignition timing is extremely important in ultra-high performance applications. While there are separate ignition control systems available, bear in mind that with separate systems the ignition and fuel systems are working independently of each other. If they are not set up properly, the two systems can actually work against each other. Stand Alone Engine Management Systems Stand Alone Engine Management Systems derive their name from the fact that the completely replace the existing engine management system. This means that there is a great deal of work to be done when installing a stand alone system. These system may require replacing engine wiring harness completely and may require replacing most or all of the factory sensors. The obvious disadvantage to this is that it requires a great deal of work to replace existing wiring. You may also have to do some fabrication to use aftermarket sensors with the 944 engine. However, these disadvantages can work to your advantage as well. Since we are installing these systems on cars that are at least 10-15 years old, much of the car's factory wiring harness probably needs replacing anyway. And, aftermarket sensors (most of them typically GM) are normally cheaper than factory sensors. While a few of the stand alone systems can use the factory crank trigger signal pickup, most will require a crankshaft trigger wheel and sensor be mounted on the front of the engine. This presents problems with regards to sensor mounting and pulley arrangement. However, isn't like you're blazing a trail because someone else has already addressed these issues and can provide you with a solution. Page 4 of 14 The primary advantage of stand alone systems is that you get complete control over the ignition and fuel maps in one location so that the system can operate as a single unit. Which means that no matter what modifications you make in the future, you'll be able to reprogram the system to compensate for the change in your setup. In addition to both fuel and ignition control, many of the stand alone systems use direct fire ignition via coil packs. This allows you to completely do away with the distributor and provide a more reliable spark to the engine. Other features which may be available with a stand alone system are: data logging, knock control, boost control, NOS control, and even engine cooling fan control. Additionally, with the use of a cam trigger in addition to the crank trigger, you can go to a true sequential fuel injection. The biggest disadvantage to stand alone systems is cost. Be prepared to spend $25003500 USD for a decent system and really high end stuff can run well over $8000 USD. For the most part, however, the less expensive systems will do as much or more than the expensive systems. Another disadvantage to stand alone systems is the installation and setup. It can take a great deal of time to install, learn how to use, and properly setup a stand alone system. Turbochargers In the early days of performance modifications about the first thing to become popular was changing to different computer chips. Shortly thereafter, the holy grail of horsepower improvement became bigger turbochargers. That philosophy was brought about in part by Porsche itself when it changed from a K26-6 turbocharger on the early 951s to a K26-8 on the later cars. After that, folks figured that they could achieve progressively greater performance by installing progressively larger turbochargers. It didn't take long for folks to figure out (myself included) that for peak performance the turbocharger must be matched to your existing air flow capabilities with a fuel management system (either remapped chips or a different management system) that is setup to provide the correct amount of fuel for your engine and turbocharger. If your engine can not provide enough air flow or even provides too much air flow for your turbocharger, it will not be operating at peak efficiency and performance will suffer dramatically. I installed a K27-8 turbocharger on my 2.5L 944 Turbo in 1994. I was so disappointed, that I almost pulled it off and threw it in the trash. There was no noticeable improvement in performance and the increase in turbo lag was, in my opinion, completely unacceptable. Fortunately, when I later increased the engine's displacement to 2.8L, the turbo appears to be an almost perfect match. However, the fact that it does seem to be such a good match is more chance than anything else. With everything else remaining stock (i.e. displacement, cylinder head, intercooler), choosing a different turbocharger is much easier. Since the stock air flow rate capability of the stock 2.5L engine is fairly fixed, matching a turbocharger to that flow rate capability is more exacting. However, when you start changing displacement, going to higher flow rate heads, or bigger intercoolers, selecting a turbocharger becomes more hit or miss. Page 5 of 14 If you have made a displacement change, changed to a different flow rate head, or installed a larger intercooler, provide all that information to your turbocharger supplier. Ideally, if you've changed to a different head, the head will have been bench flowed and those flow rate numbers provide to you with the purchase of the head. Try to select a turbocharger supplier who has a great deal of experience with providing different turbos for different combinations of engine displacement and head flow rates. Your chances of getting a better matched turbo will improve. Also, if you're using the stock engine management system make sure (up front) that your turbo supplier can also provide you with a set of chips mapped specifically for your new setup. If you're using a fuel management system or stand alone engine management system this isn't of concern as you can re-tune your system as necessary. Adjustable Fuel Pressure Regulators For low end applications where you are perhaps running a set of aftermarket chips, a different turbocharger, and boost up to about 15 psi, installing an adjustable fuel pressure regulator is, for the most part, a waste of money. The only reason for going to an adjustable fuel pressure regulator is when you're trying to make bigger horsepower numbers with stock injectors and they simply won't flow enough fuel with the lower differential pressure across the injector. If that is the case, you should be using the adjustable FPR in conjunction with a set of chips that are mapped for the fuel pressure you're running. For example some chip manufacturers may have you install an adjustable fuel pressure regulator along with their chips and adjust the base fuel pressure for 44 psi as opposed to the stock 36 psi. In my particular case, running a MAF system with a maximum boost pressure set at 18 psi, the vendor that supplied the MAF and the chips that came with it specified running the base fuel pressure at 52 psi with stock injectors. What I'm saying here is don't go out and simply plunk down your hard earned money on an adjustable FPR alone and expect it to do anything for you. If you do so, it must be for the express purpose of setting a specific fuel pressure for a specific application. Fuel Injectors Another common misconception floating around is that improved performance can be obtained by simply installing a bigger set of injectors. Not only is that incorrect but, you can also your DME computer in the process. There are basically two types of injectors on the market, high impedance injectors (with resistances typically greater than 10 ohms) and low impedance injectors which NORMALLY have resistances in the 2-3 ohm range. High impedance injectors are referred to as saturation injectors and low impedance injectors are called peak and hold injectors. The stock engine management computer uses two injector drivers with the two injectors batch fired (both fire at the same time). If you try to use injectors of a different resistance than what the injector driver is designed for, it can cause the injector driver to shut down or even burn up. Now, all 944s use low impedance peak and hold injectors. However, the 944 Turbo uses and injector with a resistance of 4.5 ohms (spec is 3.5 to 5.5 ohms). So, how many low impedance injectors do you think there are with a Page 6 of 14 resistance of 4.5 ohms (Other than the ones used in the 944 Turbo)? If you guess somewhere around none, you're absolutely correct. So, what must we do to run bigger injectors? Well, we have to do some impedance matching. That's really just a fancy term for making a resistor of a different resistance than the one you currently have appear like it has the same resistance. For example, since most low impedance injectors come in the 2-3 ohm range, we need to make two 2-3 ohm injectors wired in parallel look like two 4.5 ohm injectors wired in parallel (remember two injectors batch fired off of each injector driver). I won't go into the theory behind series and parallel resistance circuits but, to the injector driver, two 4.5 ohm injectors wired in parallel to the driver provides and equivalent resistance to the driver of 2.25 ohms (press the &quot;I believe&quot; button now). Now, let's say we want to install bigger injectors with have a resistance of 2.5 ohms. Wired in parallel to the injector driver, these provide and equivalent resistance of 1.25 ohms. So, to get up to the 2.25 ohms resistance the driver is happy with, we need to install a single 1 ohm resistor in series (commonly referred to as a ballast resistor) with the two parallel wired 2.5 ohm injectors. Now that I've gone through that long and boring explanation, I'll tell you that there are plenty of aftermarket suppliers out there who have already done all the calculations and will supply you with a set of bigger injectors and the appropriate ballast resistors to impedance match them to the stock DME injector drivers. Hope I didn't make you mad by making you sit through that explanation. However, it's my opinion that the more information you have, the more understanding you have about how your car works. With greater understanding comes better decision making when it comes to selecting equipment for performance modifications (as I climb slowly down off my soap box). Once again, bigger injectors are of little use unless you have a set of chips which are mapped based on the bigger injector capability or a tuneable fuel management system. By now you should be seeing a recurring theme here. That being, if you are to continue down the evil path of performance modifications, it is in the best interest of your sanity and pocket book to install a fuel management or stand alone engine management system early on in the game. Increasing Engine Displacement This section on increasing engine displacement is the sole reason I decided to write this document on 951 performance modifications. There is so much misunderstanding and misinformation floating around about increasing engine displacement, I thought it was time to put out as much information on the subject as possible so that folks will be able to make informed decisions with regards to increasing displacement. Page 7 of 14 There are several ways to go about increasing engine displacement on a 944 and none of them are cheap. You can increase the bore and keep the same stroke, you can increase the stroke and keep the same bore, or you can increase both the bore and the stroke (insert Tim Allen grunt here). Bottom line is, if you plan to do an increase in displacement, you'd better have very deep pockets or plan to purchase components over a long period of time to spread out the cost (as I did). I don't know who originally came up with the idea of increasing the displacement of a 944 Turbo but, early on, the only company out there offering anything was Andial. The were one of if not the first companies to offer a stroker kit for the 951. It consisted of a new 3.0L 944 S2 crankshaft, Carillo rods, and Mahle pistons which were custom made for Andial specifically for this applications. The price tag for the kit used to run somewhere in the neighborhood of $5500 USD with over $3000 USD for a new crankshaft from Porsche. One of the questions I always get asked about stroker kits is, &quot;hey, is all that stuff required&quot;? Well, to do a stroker kit, you obviously need the 3.0L crankshaft to give you the increased stroke. However, there's nothing that says you have to use a new crankshaft. When I did my stroker engine, I bought the pistons and rods from Andial and shopped around until I found a used crankshaft ($1100 USD). Now days, you can pick up a used crankshaft for $1200-1500 USD. I can't tell you how much the pistons and rods are going for today but, in 1996 the Mahle pistons were approximately $1250 and the Carillo rods about $950. The pistons are a requirement because you need a higher wrist pin location to provide valve/cylinder head clearance at TDC with the increase in stroke. The Mahle pistons are specially coated with iron to be compatible with the stock silicon impregnated alloy cylinder walls. They also have a set of moly rings which are also compatible with the alloy surface. The rods are not strictly required. However, if you stick with the factory connecting rods the sides of the main bearing saddles on the block have to be machined. The stock connecting rods have a very tall shoulder for the rod bolt. With the increase in stroke, the shoulder will come in contact with a lip on the side of the bearing saddle. So, the excess material has to be machined away to provide enough clearance. This isn't really a big deal as it's what Porsche had to do when they built the 3.0L S2 engine anyway. However, it's going to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $400-500 to have the block machined. The Carillo rods have a lower rod bolt shoulder, so they do not require the block to be machined and they are lighter and stronger than the factory connecting rod. I debated about whether to use the factory rod and ultimately decided to go with the stronger aftermarket rod. Page 8 of 14 Now days, there are many places that are offering stroker kits for 944 Turbos. The primary difference between most of these kits and the Andial kit is that they require the cylinder to be bored and a cast iron sleeve installed. Then, you can use a custom piston which does not require special coatings or special rings. J&E and Cunningham are the leading manufacturers producing custom pistons for these applications. It will cost you a little more to have the cylinders bored and sleeved but, the cost of the pistons is less so, the ultimate cost is about the same. One advantage to sleeving is that it allows the cylinder to hold up much better in the event of a catastrophic failure (i.e. a ring breaks). It also allows you to get a custom made piston in just about any size you want if you want to increase the bore. As far as I'm aware, the Mahle pistons are only available in 100 mm and 100.05 mm diameters. We'll discuss what displacements are achieved with different combinations of bore and stroke a little later. Another method of increasing displacement is to increase the bore and keeping the same stroke. This is typically less expensive than stroking an engine because it doesn't require you to buy a 3.0L crankshaft. Also, bored engines tend to develop more torque than stroked engines of similar displacement. However, I've never been a huge fan of boring the 2.5L block. The reason being that the cylinder walls on the 2.5L block aren't all that thick to begin with. And the 2.5L cylinders are free standing in the block which means they are unsupported at the top. When you overbore the block for a displacement increase, cylinder walls get very thin and even with cast iron sleeves, the cylinders are weakened to the point that they have been known to move at extremely high loads. And when the cylinders start moving, you start blowing head gaskets. For over bore applications, the 3.0L block is a much better candidate for boring. The cylinder walls are much beefier than the 2.5L block to begin with and the cylinders are tied together at the top with webbing for additional support. Then of course if you want to go to a really large displacement engine, you can go to an engine that is bored and stroked. Again, the 3.0L block is a much better candidate for this type of displacement increase. So, let's talk actual numbers. The bore and stroke of the 2.5L engine is 100 mm x 78.9 mm. If you calculate the numbers, the actual displacement is 2.479L. For the 3.0L engine ( Bore = 104 mm, Stroke = 87.8 mm), the actual displacement is 2.983L. Now, if we install a 3.0L crankshaft into a standard bore 2.5L engine, we increase the displacement to 2.758L. This is what we typically refer to as the 2.8L stroker engine. If we bore and sleeve the engine to 104 mm (standard 3.0L bore) and keep the 2.5L crankshaft, we increase the displacement to 2.680L (commonly referred to as a 2.7L). I have seen the 2.5L engine bored and sleeved to as much as 106 mm which with a 2.5L crankshaft yields a displacement of 2.785L. This is actually a slight increase in displacement over what most stroker kits provide in displacement. However, over the long haul it isn't nearly as reliable. Page 9 of 14 For displacements larger than 3.0L, the 3.0L 944 S2 or 968 block should be used as a starting point. However, using the 3.0L block does pose some problems. The biggest problem has to do with the cylinder head. The 944 Turbo cylinder head will not mate up to the 3.0L block due to the difference in cooling passages at the front of the cylinder head. There are several possible solutions to this problem. First, you can have the 944 Turbo cylinder head modified so that it will mate directly to the 3.0L block. This involves welding a boss on to the cooling passage at the front of the head and then machining a new cooling passage to mate up with the 3.0L block. There are several 944 performance shops who are doing this and I have yet to hear anything negative about going this route. However, bear in mind that there aren't a lot of people out there doing 3.0L+ engines in 944s. The cost for modifying the 944 Turbo head is about $350. The next option is to obtain a cylinder head from a normally aspirated 1989 944. This was a 2.7L engine that was only made by Porsche for one model year and the 2.7L engines are somewhat rare. Most of the normally aspirated cars produced in 1989 were the 3.0L 944 S2 engines which utilized a 16V head. The 2.7L engine used the same block as the S2 engine but, used and 8V head and the 2.5L crankshaft. So, the 2.7L head will mate directly to the 3.0L block without modification. However, you will need to swap to a high temperature exhaust valve similar to the one used in the 951 head. If I'm not mistaken, the 2.7L valve has a different diameter stem than the turbo valves. So, if you wanted to use the 944 Turbo valves you'd also have to change to the 951 valve guides. The final, and by far most costly option, is to use the 3.0L 16V cylinder head. Again this will require changing to a high temperature exhaust valve which in this case will have to be custom made. You'll also need to custom fabricate intake and exhaust manifolds to match up to the 16V head. On the intake you can take an intake from a 944 S2 or 968, cut the flange off which mates to the cylinder head and weld it onto a 944 Turbo intake manifold. As you might imagine, all this can run up the price tag very quickly. However, the 16V head is capable of a lot more flow than the 8V head so, if you're planning on an extremely high horsepower application and you're willing to spend the bucks, the 16V head is worth consideration. A number of folks have asked me about simply turbocharging a normally aspirated 3.0L engine. Aside from needing to swap to a high temperature exhaust valves, you'll also need to do something to reduce the compression ratio down to a level that is acceptable for a turbocharged engine (ideally less than 8.5:1). This means that you'll also have to swap to a custom made piston. However, there is no one currently making a 3.0L piston that is compatible with the stock alloy bore. Again, you have several options: 1) Have someone make a custom set of pistons and send them out to be specially coated and obtain the proper rings for compatibility, OR 2) Have the block bored and sleeved and obtain a set of custom pistons which do not require coating. So much for displacement increases. Let's move on to something else. Page 10 of 14 Wastegates and Boost Controllers Over time, the spring in the factory wastegate will weaken causing the gate to leak by thus preventing the engine from developing maximum boost. You can replace the factory wastegate with a new wastegate from Porsche. However, a new wastegate is brutally expensive. You can also install shims between the wastegate diaphragm and valve body. This will preload the spring and restore it back close to the original closing force (or greater depending on the number and thickness of shims installed). However, this is really only a band aid fix. Finally, you can replace the wastegate with an aftermarket replacement wastegate. The only problem with aftermarket wastegates is that in most cases they are not a direct bolt-in. The only direct bolt-in replacement (Lindsey Racing) uses a factory wastegate valve body with a different diaphragm (which provides for single or dual-port operation). The Lindsey wastegate requires that you exchange your factory wastegate and that your exchange wastegate be in rebuildable condition. Otherwise a core charge applies. Other wastegates that are being used are Deltas and Tials. The Delta gates are generally less expensive than the Tial wastegates. However, the Tial gates seem to be a lot more reliable. Again, most factory wastegates are not direct bolt-in items. They may require custom flange fabrication and some welding to install. However, some of the performance shops offer packages which include everything to make the aftermarket gate a direct bolt-in. So, when purchasing an aftermarket wastegate, make sure you ask what has to be done to install the gate and if they offer an installation kit. With regards to boost controllers there are basically two types: manual or electronic. Manual boost controllers can be installed under the hood or may be plumbed through the firewall to provide cockpit control. Electronic boost controllers typically have a solenoid valve mounted in the engine compartment to control the opening pressure going to the wastegate. They will have a wiring harness going from the solenoid to the electronic control box which is normally mounted in the passenger's compartment. With regards to advantages and disadvantages, electronic boost controllers are supposed to be more accurate and provide better repeatability at the set boost pressure. I can't confirm or deny that. I'm only repeating what I've heard from others. Manual boost controllers are much less expensive than electronic controllers. Electronic controllers will run in the $350-600 USD price range while a good manual boost controller will run less than $100 USD. Quite honestly, I think manual boost controllers are a lot easier to install and set up as well. I currently have an electronic boost controller and am seriously considering a swap to a manual boost controller. Page 11 of 14 Oiling System 944s have long been notorious for experiencing oiling problems with the #2 rod bearing, particularly during hard cornering. There has been a lot of conjecture over the years as to what exactly causes this problem and most of the reasoning seems plausible. In all likelihood there is no single cause of the problem but, is probably a combination of a number of these factors. One of the factors attributed to the problem is the shear size of the 944 oil pan. It is very large across the bottom and in hard cornering the oil is forced to one side of the pan which can cause the oil pickup tube to become uncovered. Another theory that has been postulated is that windage from the crankshaft and pistons as they rotate inside the engine cause foaming of the oil inside the pan causing the oil pickup tube to become uncovered. Additionally, it has been suggested that the rotation of the pistons up and down cause pressure waves in the oil in the pan which could cause the oil pickup to become uncovered. There are a number of solutions which are being used but, it's not really clear just how effective they are. The simplest and least costly fix is to simply run the oil level at or slight above the high level mark on the dipstick. Most folks say running 1/2 quart high is a good idea especially when running the car on the track. Even if you perform the other modifications for this problem, it's still probably a good idea. One of the primary fixes for this problem is to drill an additional oil passage in the crankshaft rod journal. The simplest way to do this is to simply drill straight through the existing passage to the other side of the crankshaft. This is referred to as &quot;cross-drilling&quot;. Another method is do drill another passage in the rod journal at a 90° angle to the original passage. This is referred to as &quot;perp&quot; (perpendicular) drilling. Of the two, perp drilling is a little more difficult. However, it is also supposed to be more effective. I can't comment one way or the other on that. Another modifications for the problem is to rebaffle the oil pan. Most places will charge you upwards of $250 for this modifications including exchanging your old pan. However, this modification is something that a good machinist can do for you much cheaper. Part of the modification involves installing a barn door on one side of the pan. It consists of a piano hinge and a piece of sheet aluminum to form the door. The door is mounted to swing out toward the center of the pan such that in a hard corner the door closes to impede the flow of oil the large open area on that side of the pan. The door is fabricated such that when it is closed there is a small gap between the door and the bottom of pan. The other modification is made to the oil pickup tube. At the bottom of the tube is a screen to prevent debris from being picked up by the oil pump. The screen has almost a half moon shape to it which means that the actual pickup point is close to 1&quot; off the bottom of the pan. The modification involve welding a metal band around the circumference of the screen about 3/4&quot; wide which effective lowers the pickup point. Page 12 of 14 Another modification used to alleviate this problem is to drill passages in the main bearing saddles. This is supposed to allow free air flow between the saddles thus reducing the pressure wave effect caused by the pistons moving up and down. On modification that has been used for years in other engine applications is to knife-edge the crankshaft. This acts to reduce foaming of oil in the pan. The last modification I'm aware of for this problem is the installation of an Accusump system. This system consists of a canister with a pressurized volume of oil. If a loss of oil pressure is sensed, the system will provide pressurized oil to the bearings. Many of the owners I've talked to who have this system feel like it is a waste of money and that the delay time associated with the oil being supplied to the bearings is too great to provide adequate protection. Crankshaft and Flywheel If you reduce the rotating mass of the engine, it will spin up much more quickly. One of the things you can do to accomplish this is to lighten the crankshaft. I've known of places that take as much as 17 lbs. off of the crankshaft. However, when you take too much weight off the crankshaft the engine has a tendency to stall when it is running and drops back to an idle condition. I don't recommend reducing the crankshaft weight by more than 10 lbs. As we mentioned in the previous section, knife-edging the crankshaft is used to prevent foaming the oil in the pan. However, it has the additional advantage of reducing the rotating mass and reducing the windage losses inside the engine. Another method of reducing the engine's rotating mass is to use a lighter flywheel. This can be done by machining the factory flywheel to reduce the weight or by using an aluminum flywheel. Lightening a factory flywheel will normally run around $200 USD while an aluminum flywheel will normally cost $500-600 USD. Cat Bypass Pipes Let's start off with an obligatory disclaimer. Strictly speaking cat bypass pipes are illegal from an emissions standpoint. They should only be used for &quot;track only&quot; cars that are not registered for street use. However, I can tell you that a cat bypass pipe will provide a noticeable improvement in performance. By reducing the backpressure on the discharge of the turbocharger, it reduces the turbo spool up time and thus the turbo lag. Page 13 of 14 Summary There are a number of other modifications related to engine performance available. They range from improved intake manifolds, cylinder heads with larger intake and exhaust valves, larger exhaust systems, better flowing intercooler pipes, and bigger intercoolers. As I have more time to work on this document down the road I will probably address more of these. Bottom line is you can spend about as much money on performance modifications as your wallet will allow. Choose them wisely. Drive it like you stole it. Page 14 of 14");sQ1[272]=new Array("pdf-manual/eng-17.pdf","Engine Oil and Filter Change","","ENG-17, Engine Oil and Filter Change Introduction Porsche recommends replacing the oil and filter every 7500 miles for turbocharged cars and every 15000 miles for normally aspirated cars. This is one of the few times I feel that Porsche erred in the non-conservative direction with regards to a maintenance interval. Frequent oil changes are vital to the longevity of a car's engine. Consequently, I change the oil and filter in my own car's religiously every 3000 miles. I don't recommend allowing a car to go more than 5000 miles between oil changes. Regardless of how often you decide to change your oil, pick a replacement interval and stick to it. You'll see better long-term performance from you car's engine. Tools · · · · · 17 mm socket and ratchet OR 17 mm combination wrench Type J Oil Filter Wrench Jack Stands and Floor Jack OR Ramps Drain Pan Catch Rags Parts · · · Mahle OC 142 * Oil Filter OR Porsche OEM Filter (944 107 201 90) Oil o Approximately 5.5 liters (5.8 US quarts) filled to the upper dipstick mark Oil Drain Plug Seal Ring (26 x 32 mm - 900 123 049 30) * You may also use the Mahle OC 75 Oil Filter which is a taller version of the OC 142. This filter was used on some 911 Turbo models. If you happen to lose or damage the Oil Pan Drain Plug the Porsche part number is N 016 164 1. It is an M20 x 1.5 plug and you may be able to find it at an Auto Pats Store without having to buy it from Porsche. Page 1 of 3 Procedure 1. Run the vehicle for a few minutes to warm the engine oil before remove. With the oil warm it tends to flow better and thus remove more sludge / deposits from the engine. 2. Raise the front of the vehicle on jack stands or ramps. NOTE All 944s came from the factory with two skid pans. One covered the front-bottom part of the engine compartment (below the accessory belts). The other covered the bottom-rear part of the engine compartment (below the oil pan). To do an oil change, the rear skid pan had to be removed to access the oil pan drain plug. On most 944s, this rear skid pan has long since been discarded. Most 944 owners found it much easier to change the oil if they didn't have to remove that pan every time. Also, the engine tends to run a bit cooler as there is more air flow across the oil pan and hence better oil cooling. Again, most 944s don't have this pan anymore but, you may find that your 944 has this pan in place. It will have to be removed to change the oil. 3. Some folks will tell you that the oil filter will not make as bit a mess if you punch a hole in the top of the filter before you remove it. Other folks will tell you it makes no difference. And, some folks will tell you it makes an even bigger mess. Anyway, if you decide to try this, punch a hole in the top-center portion of the filter before removing the oil pan drain plug. The oil flowing out of the pan will help draw the oil out of the filter and make this method more effective. 4. Place a catch pan underneath the oil pan below the oil pan drain plug. 5. Using a 17 mm socket and ratchet or 17 mm combination wrench, remove the oil pan drain plug. 6. After the oil has drained for a few minutes, remove the oil fill cap. If you didn't punch a hole in the oil filter to help it drain, you can remove the oil fill cap prior to removing the oil pan drain plug. 7. Inspect the oil pan drain plug seal ring. If it has scratches or gouges, or if it is deformed at all, replace it. 8. When the engine oil has completely drained, replace the drain plug with seal ring and torque to 50 Nm (37 ft-lbs.). 9. Move the the drain pan underneath the oil filter area. 10. Stuff as many catch rags as possible around an below the oil filter. Using an appropriate oil filter wrench, remove the oil filter. 11. Apply a coating of new engine oil to the seal ring on the new oil filter. This prevents tearing the seal during installation and also makes removal of the filter easier in the future when you have to replace it. 12. Install the new filter hand tight. Most manufacturers don't recommend using a filter wrench to torque a filter on during installation. You can but, don't turn the filter more than 1/4 turn past hand tight. Page 2 of 3 13. Fill the engine with new oil and check the dipstick level prior to starting the engine. Fill to at least the high mark as some of the oil will be pumped up into the oil filter and remain there when the engine is started. 14. Start the engine and check for normal oil pressure. 15. Remove the car from ramps or jack stands. If jack stands were used stop the engine before removing the car from the jack stands. 16. Stop the engine and allow it to sit for 5-10 minutes to allow all the oil to drain back to the pan. 17. With the car sitting on level ground, check the engine oil level again and top off as necessary. 18. Take the used oil to an approved disposal facility.

That means that the steering rack and engine cross-member should already be removed from the car. 1. For manual transmission cars, if the clutch disc and/or pressure plate was removed while the engine was out of the car, ensure that the clutch disc has been aligned with the pressure plate prior to attempting to install the engine. Actually, the should have been done prior to installing the engine's bell housing. You can obtain a clutch alignment tool from Baum Tool. However, a universal clutch alignment tool which can be obtained at most major auto parts stores will work just as well. 2. Ensure that the motor mount brackets are attached to the engine block. 3. Ensure that the car is raised high enough to slide the engine underneath. Position the engine under the car in the center of the engine compartment. 4. Attach an engine hoist or chain hoist to the engine's lifting points (2 - one at the back of the cam housing, one near the alternator). Page 1 of 4 5. Raise the engine into position in the car. The engine will have to be move toward the front of the engine compartment to clear the front end of the drive shaft. When the end of the drive shaft is positioned in the center of the opening in the clutch housing, slide the hoist toward the rear of the car. The engine may have to be rocked slightly as it is moved back onto the drive shaft. However, if the clutch disc is aligned properly, the drive shaft should insert without a great deal of effort. 6. Install the torque tube (central tube) flange to clutch housing bolts (4, M10 x 35mm). Torque bolts to 42 Nm (30 ft-lbs). Note Prior to installing the cross-member, check the motor mounts using ENG-11, to see if they need to be replaced. 7. Ensure the engine motor mounts are installed into the cross-member. Install the lower motor mount bolts (10 mm) but, do not fully tighten until the cross-member is raised into place. NOTE If new motor mounts have been installed, use ENG-12 to determine the correct length of upper motor mount bolts (4 - 8mm bolts) to be used. 8. Using a floor jack, raise the cross-member into position under the engine. Check to make sure that the motor mounts line up with the motor mount brackets on the engine block. 9. You'll probably find it easiest to slide the steering shaft universal joint on to the spline inlet shaft of the steering rack before the cross-member is fully raised into position. Be sure to install the universal joint in the correct orientation as marked on the input shaft splines and universal joint during removal. Install the universal joint locking bolt. 10. Install the upper motor mount bolts (8mm) and using a 13 mm socket torque to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). Using a 17 mm socket, torque the lower motor mount bolts to 32 ft-lbs. 11. When the cross-member is fully raised into position, install the cross-member mounting bolts (12 mm) and using a 19 mm socket, torque to 85 Nm (63 ft-lbs). 12. Disconnect the engine hoist and move the hoist and floor jack out of the way. 13. Install the suspension control arms and stabilizer bar. Torque the control arm to cross-member lock nut (12 mm) to 48 ft-lbs. Torque the rear control arm mounting bracket bolts (10 mm) to 34 ft-lbs. This is the assembly for the eccentric caster bolt at the rear of the control arm. Page 2 of 4 14. Attach the steering knuckle to the control arm ball joint. Torque the steering knuckle lock nut (10 mm) to 37 ft-lbs. 15. Bolt the air condition compressor into place. 16. Install the front stabilizer bar. Torque the stabilizer to control arm lock nut (10 mm) to 18 ft-lbs. Torque the stabilizer bracket to body bolts (8 mm) to 17 ft-lbs. 17. Install the alternator, if removed. 18. Install motor mount heat shield. 19. Install slave cylinder. 20. Install the exhaust system. 21. If equipped, install the oxygen sensor (USA cars) 22. Attach fuel supply and return lines. 23. Install the charcoal venting hose. 24. Install the AC fast idle hose. 25. Install all vacuum and coolant hoses. 26. Reattach the hose to the heater control valve and the hose for the coolant return line from the heater core. 27. Install the power steering pump and reconnect hoses. 28. Install the starter and reconnect electrical leads. 29. Route the engine wiring harness through the firewall to the DME control unit. 30. Reconnect all engine grounds. There should be a connection near the top of the clutch housing on the driver's side of the vehicle (RHD) and a connection on the block near the same location. There should also be a ground connection on the firewall either inside the engine compartment or inside the battery compartment. BE SURE TO CLEAN ALL GROUND CONNECTIONS THOROUGHLY BEFORE INSTALLATION. A bad ground connection can result in poor running and may lead to eventual failure of the DME control unit. 31. Connect the brake booster vacuum hose. 32. Connect the throttle cable and, if equipped, the cruise control cable and cruise control unit servo electrical connector. 33. Install the radiator using COOL-04. 34. On turbocharged cars install the turbocharger cooling pump, connect hoses, and electrical connector. 35. Install the rotor and distributor cap using IGN-01. 36. Install the air flow sensor and air filter housing using AF-01. 37. Attach the engine wiring harness to the firewall using appropriate cable ties. 38. Inside car, connect the wiring harness to the DME control unit (and KLR on turbo models). 39. Using COOL-02, fill and vent the coolant system. 40. Fill the power steering reservoir. 41. Check the engine oil for proper level. 42. Connect the battery leads. Page 3 of 4 43. Install the fuse for the fuel pump, if removed. 44. Start vehicle and allow to warm up. Check for leaks in the engine compartment and underneath the vehicle. Move steering wheel from side to side and check level in power steering reservoir. Add fluid as necessary. 45. Stop vehicle, install skid pan, front wheels, and lower vehicle from jack stands.

Remove the fuse for the fuel pump. 2. Attempt to start the vehicle. The vehicle may start but should immediately stall as the fuel system depressurizes. 3. Disconnect the battery as follows: . Disconnect the battery ground cable and then the battery positive cable. a. Push the positive cable through the hole in the firewall and into the engine compartment. (Removing the battery will make getting the cable through the firewall much easier) b. If equipped with cruise control, disconnect the electrical connector at the cruise control servo unit near the passenger's side strut tower. 4. Using DME-01, disconnect the DME Control Unit. On turbo models, also disconnect the KLR Control Unit. 5. Release/cut tie wraps (depending on type) at the firewall to get the battery cable out of the way of the DME wire bundle. 6. Pull the DME control unit plug through the opening in the firewall and into the engine compartment. (There may be several other cable connectors near the DME that have wires running in the DME wire bundle which will have to be disconnected to get the wire bundle through the firewall. Ensure all wires are disconnected before attempting to pull the bundle through the firewall). 7. Using AF-01, remove the air filter housing and the air flow sensor assembly. 8. On turbo model, remove the throttle body inlet line from the intercooler, and the rubber inlet plenum boot. Page 1 of 4 9. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap, rotor, and dust cap. 10. Loosen the lug nuts on the wheels enough to allow them to be removed easily once the car is raised. (One or two turns is more than enough) 11. Place the vehicle on jack stands. The engine is removed from underneath the vehicle so at least 21 inches of clearance is required. Raising the vehicle to a lower height initially will simplify any work done from above. The vehicle can then be raised to obtain clearance just prior to removing the front cross-member. 12. Remove the front wheels. 13. From underneath the car, remove all skid/belly pans which protects the bottom of the engine. On models which have the &quot;turbo&quot; aerodynamics package, you will need to remove the skid pan under the nose panel as well. NOTE: Many of the cars that have been around for a while have had the back belly pan removed and left off for easier access to the oil drain plug. 14. Using COOL-04, remove the radiator from the car. 15. On turbocharged cars perform the following: a. Loosen and remove the hose from the coolant expansion tank to the turbocharger and the hose to the turbocharger pump suction. b. Loosen the hose on the turbocharger pump discharge , disconnect the pump electrical connector, and remove the pump and mounting bracket from the car. NOTE Clean as much debris from the radiator coils as you can while you have it out of the car. You may also want to have the radiator inspected/tested by your local radiator shop while it is out of the car. It's also a good time to install new radiator hoses and a lower temperature thermofan switch if you've been considering either. 16. Unplug all wiring harness connectors at the firewall and finishing releasing/cutting any cable ties attaching the harness to the firewall. 17. Disconnect the throttle cable. If equipped with cruise control, disconnect the cruise control cable as well. 18. Disconnect the brake booster vacuum hose. 19. Disconnect the engine ground cables at the firewall. 20. In the engine compartment, disconnect the starter wiring connector. 21. Remove the starter from the vehicle. 22. Disconnect the hoses from the power steering pump and remove the pump. 23. Remove the clutch slave cylinder bracket bolts. 24. Mark all hoses which must be removed from the car for ease of installation. 25. Remove the coolant hose on the heater valve. Page 2 of 4 26. Remove the coolant return heater hose at the rear of the cylinder head. 27. If not already done, remove the coolant feed hoses on the expansion tank. 28. Remove the vacuum lines to the vent valve and the thermo valve at the back of the engine. 29. Remove the A/C fast idle hose. 30. Remove the charcoal venting hose. 31. Disconnect the fuel supply and return lines. The fuel system should be depressurized but, a small amount of fuel may leak from the fuel rail or the fuel lines when disconnected. Hose clamps or locking pliers can be used as an additional measure to prevent leakage. If you decide not to use clamps, have some rags handy to catch any leaking fuel. 32. Attach an engine hoist to the lifting rings mounted on the engine. 33. If equipped with an oxygen sensor (USA cars), disconnect the O2 sensor wire at the fire wall and remove the O2 sensor from the exhaust. 34. Remove the exhaust system. 35. Unbolt the slave cylinder and move it out of the way, leaving the fluid lines attached. 36. Remove the right side motor mount shield. 37. Remove the alternator. This step is called for the in the factory manual. However, the engine can be removed with the alternator installed. 38. Remove the front stabilizer bar assembly-to-chassis (drop link) bolts and control arm bolts and remove the stabilizer from the vehicle. 39. Unbolt the air conditioning compressor, with lines intact, and hang it from the front strut spring. 40. Remove the bolts that attach the torque tube to the clutch housing. 41. Disconnect the steering tie rod ends. 42. Place alignment marks on the splined input shaft on the steering rack and the universal joint on the steering shaft so they can be assembled in the same orientation on installation. ( A punch and hammer or brightly colored finger nail polish will work fine.) 43. Disconnect the steering gear shaft using a punch and hammer. Be careful not to damage the splines on the steering shaft. 44. Remove the bolts that attach the suspension control arm to the chassis. 45. Disconnect the suspension ball joints on the control arm. 46. Remove the motor mount nuts and bolts. 47. Support the cross member using a floor jack and a piece of wood. 48. With the engine supported by the engine hoist above, remove the cross member bolts. 49. Disconnect the cross member with the steering rack and stabilizer bar attached and lower it from the vehicle. Page 3 of 4 50. Lower the engine from the car, moving it forward to disengage the drive shaft splines from the engine as it is lowered. Lowering the engine on to a piece of carpet or cardboard will make it easier to slide the engine out from underneath the car. 51. Disconnect the hoist from the engine and slide the engine out from underneath the car. 52. Attach the hoist to the engine and move the engine to a suitable place to be worked on.

Slide the hose (still attached to the cooling pump) off of the pipe and move out of the way toward the front of the car. Some coolant will come out of the turbocharger cooling jacket. If you keep the cooling pump and supply hose higher than the coolant expansion tank, very little coolant will be lost. f. Using a 22 mm wrench and a 27 mm wrench, remove the 90° bend cooling water supply pipe and the threaded nipple on the jacket water supply to the turbocharger. g. From above, remove the two turbocharger inlet flange nuts and bolts at the top of the flange and the nut and bolt on the bottom of the flange nearest the front of the car. These require two 15 mm wrenches or a wrench and 15 mm socket. h. From above, disconnect the O2 sensor electrical connector (round connector on the mounting bracket at the back of the intake manifold). i. From under the car, remove the O2 sensor. j. Remove the turbocharger inlet flange bolt on the bottom of the flange nearest the back of the car. This requires a 15 mm wrench or socket. However, no wrench is need for the nut as it is tack welded to the flange. k. Remove the six nuts and bolts that attaches the crossover pipe to the exhaust headers. l. For models with a two-piece crossover pipe, remove the nuts and bolts on the triangle shaped flange between the crossover pipe and the wastegate. m. For cars with a one-piece crossover pipe it will be necessary to remove the wastegate to remove the crossover pipe. n. Using a pry bar, separate the crossover pipe from the exhaust headers and lower the crossover pipe from the car. Page 2 of 3 Exhaust Manifold Removal 1. Remove the six nuts and bolts on the flanges between the exhaust manifolds and the exhaust pipe (crossover pipe on Turbo models). 2. Remove the two Allen head bolts that attach the coolant return pipe to the cam housing. NOTE It may be necessary to remove the coolant return pipe completely to get the exhaust headers out. This will require partially draining the coolant system. 3. To remove the exhaust manifolds it is necessary to remove the exhaust manifold studs. To do this, loosen the exhaust nut several turns and then install a second nut onto the stud. Tighten the outside nut against the inside nut while holding the inside nut with a wrench to prevent it from turning. Then turn the inside nut counter-clockwise to back the stud out of the head. If the nuts turn on the stud, the outside nut needs to be tightened. 4. Remove the exhaust manifolds from the car. Installation There are very few instances when I invoke the standard &quot;installation is the reverse of removal&quot;. However, this is one of those rare cases.

Bosch claims that all their spec information is proprietary and only released to manufacturers who purchase injectors for a specific application. Also, the information provided below lists the rated injector flows at a specific test pressure. Normally, Bosch injectors are tested at 3 bar. However, in some cases they are tested at 2.5 bar or 2.7 bar. Realize that in our applications, the injectors probably don't operate at the test pressure list and the injectors may flow more or less than the rated flow depending on the pressure at which the system actually operates.

Remove the carpet from the rear hatch area. 2. Remove the fuel sender cover. The cover will likely be covered with an insulation pad. 3. Disconnect the electrical connector from the top of the fuel level sender. 4. Using the Multimeter and variable potentiometer, set the potentiometer to one of the resistances in the appropriate table for your car. 5. Connect the potentiometer between Terminals 1 and 3 on the connector. On some cars, Terminal 1 may be labeled &quot;G&quot; and Terminal 3 may be labeled &quot;31&quot; or &quot;T&quot;. Make sure that no wires touch a point on the body or fuel tank where they could become grounded. 6. Turn the ignition to the &quot;ON&quot; position. 7. Check the indication of the fuel level gauge. The level should indicate approximately the level from the table for the installed resistance.. 8. Turn the ignition to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. 9. Remove the installed resistance. 10. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for several resistances across the full range of indication. Results If the indications on the fuel level gauge do not agree with those list above, the wiring from the sender to the gauge or the gauge itself is the problem. If you suspect that there is a problem with the gauge portion of the circuit, first try cleaning the fuel sender grounds. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), the fuel sender grounding point is in the rear hatch area near the left rear light. On late model 944s, the fuel level sender grounding point is on the inside of the firewall on the driver's side of the vehicle (LHD). Page 2 of 4 You may also try cleaning the electrical connections at the gauge. On newer model cars with instrument clusters, remove the gauge package (ELECT-07) and clean the ribbon connectors on the back of the gauge package with a pencil eraser. On early model cars, remove the gauges using ELECT-06. Clean the contacts for the fuel level gauge and replace the instrument cluster. If the original test results indicated a problem with the gauge or gauge wiring and the problems persist after cleaning the grounding points and gauge connections, you may want to send the fuel pressure gauge (early cars) or the gauge cluster (later cars) to an authorized repair facility to be checked. I recommend sending the gauges to North Hollywood Speedometer or you can contact VDO to find an authorized repair facility near you.

Apparently, you now have to go through one of their authorized repair facilities (i.e. NHS is an authorized repair facility). Page 3 of 4 Fuel Level Sender If results from the test of the fuel level gauge indicate that the gauge is working properly, the cause of the problem is most likely the fuel level sender. Quite often the fuel level sender can become gummed up and a good cleaning may correct the problem. 1. Start by removing the fuel level sender from the tank. To do this you'll need to disconnect the electrical connector for the sending unit. 2. Next, disconnect the two fuel lines on top of tank. 3. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the black plastic locking ring counter-clockwise to remove. 4. On pre-1985.5 cars, remove the five cheesehead screws that hold the sender to the top of the fuel tank. 5. Lift the fuel sending unit out of the top of the fuel tank. 6. Thoroughly clean the sender float and slide mechanism using a good engine degreaser or carburetor and choke cleaner and a brush. 7. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 1 and 3 on the sender. 8. With the float all the way down, the resistance should read approximately RESERVE resistance (see table above for specific resistance for your model year). 9. Slowly move the float up while watching the resistance reading. As you move the float up, the resistance should slowly decrease to approximately 3 ohms with the float all the way up. 10. The decrease in resistance should be fairly linear and smooth. If you notice any erratic changes in resistance, then the sender is bad or needs additional cleaning. 11. If satisfactory resistance readings can not be obtained, the sender should be replaced.

The first choice is to buy a fuel pressure gauge with metric fittings and metric adapters. However, these are typically very expensive and if you own other cars that are made in the USA, you won't be able to use the fuel pressure gauge on them. The second choice is to buy a cheap 0-100 fuel pressure gauge which is made to check the fuel pressure on cars made in the US. However, you'll have to make a Metric-to-SAE adapter to be able to use it. The procedure that follows will describe two methods of making an adapter to use an SAE thread fuel pressure gauge. Most fuel pressure gauges made for US cars use a female 1/4&quot; flare fitting for the gauge. So, this procedure is written assuming that your particular gauge has that fitting. If you find that your pressure gauge has some other size fitting, you'll have to adjust the procedure accordingly. Tools and Materials NOTE When you are looking for a brass fitting, you may find it easier to locate a 1/4&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; flare fitting. If so, you'll need a 1/4&quot; NPT tap instead of a 1/8&quot; NPT tap. The reason I chose the 1/8&quot; NPT fitting is that when you're drill half way through each side of the adapter and then threading it, it's easier to see the transition from one type of thread to the other with the 1/8&quot; NPT thread on one side. · · · · · · 1 Piece of Round Stock, Aluminum or Mild Steel, 7/8&quot; to 1&quot; diameter (minimum 7/8&quot;), approximately 1&quot; long (Option 2) 1/8&quot; NPT Tap (Option 1 and 2) 12 mm x 1.5 Tap (Option 2) Brass male-to-male fitting (1/8&quot; NPT to 1/4&quot; flare) (Option 2) Spare fuel rail cap nut, Porsche P/N 928 110 475 01 (Option 1) Teflon thread tape (Option 1 and 2) Page 1 of 2 Option 1 1.

Apply teflon thread tape to the brass male-to-male fitting and thread into cap nut. Option 2 1. Center punch an indent in the middle of the round stock and drill a small pilot hole all the way through. 2. From one end drill about half way through the piece of round stock using a 10 mm or 13/32&quot; drill bit. 3. Thread the opening just drilled with a 12 mm x 1.5 pitch tap. 4.

However, it's quite understandable as faulty FPRs can display a wide range of symptoms depending on how the regulator fails. Also, the function and location of the FPR is quite often confused with the fuel damper. The fuel damper is on the supply to the fuel rail and functions to &quot;dampen&quot; the pulsations caused by the fuel injectors. The fuel pressure regulator is located on the return to the fuel tank and functions to control the pressure on the fuel rail.

If you have access to a 0-100 psi fuel pressure gauge , check the fuel pressure at the rail using FUEL-01. Normally a faulty fuel pressure regulator will result in a very high fuel pressure. So, if your fuel pressure is well above the specs provided in FUEL-01, you probably have a bad FPR. One of the most common failure modes for the FPR is to fail closed to the point that fuel rail pressure is extremely high. The high differential pressure across the injectors causes them to draw excessive current. The excessive current is seen by the injector drivers which subsequently shutdown. If you have a condition where the car will not start or starts and almost immediately dies, try disconnecting the wire for one (1) injector. Attempt to start the engine. If it starts and continues to run, the fuel pressure regulator is likely bad. Bear in mind that running on only three cylinders, the car will run very rough. By disconnecting one injector, it reduces the current enough to keep the injector drivers from shutting down. Page 3 of 4 Replacement 1. Disconnect the fuel pressure regulator vacuum line. 2. Place a catch rag under the regulator fuel line connection. 3. Disconnect the fuel line from the fuel pressure regulator. Normally this will be a hose clamp that can be removed by either a flat tip or Phillips head screwdriver. CAUTION Use caution when removing the fuel pressure regulator from the fuel rail as the rail may be under pressure and can spray into your face and eyes. It's a good idea to wear safety glasses while removing the regulator as well as covering the regulator with a rag. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Remove the fuel pressure regulator retaining bolts.

If you have a fuel pump that needs to be replaced, there is likely something else that has caused the fuel pump to fail. So, before you simply replace the fuel, you may want to see if there is another problem that caused the fuel pump to fail. A clogged fuel filter can cause failure of the fuel pump. A failing fuel pressure regulator can also result in pump failure. It's a good idea when installing a new pump to perform a fuel pressure check and pump delivery rate check.

If it does start, allow it to run until it stops due to lack of fuel. 2. Disconnect the battery negative lead. 3. Raise the rear of the vehicle by placing it on jack stands or ramps. 4. If the vehicle is equipped with a cover for the fuel pump (at the bottom of the fuel tank) remove the fuel pump cover. The cover will have a strap holding it to the bottom of the fuel tank and a single bolt (13 mm head) near the wheel well. Page 1 of 3 5. Disconnect the electrical leads from the fuel pump. Depending on the model of the vehicle, you may have to disconnect the lead from the pump or there may be a two prong plug connector near the pump that may simply be unplugged. 6. Using hose clamp pliers or locking pliers, clamp off the line from the fuel tank to the suction of the fuel pump. If regular locking pliers are used, it's a good idea to wrap the fuel line to keep the teeth on the locking pliers from damaging the fuel line. Page 2 of 3 Fuel Pump Electrical Plug 7. Loosen the hose clamp on the fuel pump suction line and disconnect the line from the pump. Have some catch rags and a pan ready to catch any residual fuel which will drain from the line. 8. Using the appropriate size wrenches, disconnect the discharge line from the fuel pump. 9. Loosen the hose clamp holding the fuel pump and slide the pump out of the holder. Installation 1. Prior to installation of the new fuel pump, compare the fittings to make sure the new pump has all the correct fittings. If all the correct fittings have not been supplied with the new pump, transfer fitting from the old pump to the new as necessary. 2. Slide the new fuel pump into the fuel pump holder. Tighten the clamp that holds the fuel pump in place. Do not over tighten the clamp as it can damage the fuel pump motor. 3. Attach the suction line and discharge line to the new fuel pump. 4. Remove the hose clamp from the pump suction line. 5. Connect the electrical leads to the fuel pump. 6. Connect the battery negative lead. 7. Install the fuel pump fuse (see Removal section for fuse location). 8. Start the vehicle to check for proper operation of the fuel pump and to check for fuel system leaks. 9. If equipped with a fuel pump cover, install the cover. 10. Remove the vehicle from jack stands or ramps.

Now, most people realize that there is a fuel filter on the discharge side of the fuel pump. However, most people are unaware that there is also a strainer on the suction side of the pump. The strainer is part of the fuel tank outlet line and requires draining the fuel tank to clean or replace the strainer. So, is you have a low fuel system pressure as measured at the fuel rail or are experiencing a low fuel pump capacity, before you replace the pump, first try replacing the fuel filter. Next, try cleaning the fuel pump suction strainer. Then, if neither of those fixes the problem, it's time to consider replacing the fuel pump. Also, I've seen instances where leaks at the fuel tank resulted from a failed seal for the fuel pump suction strainer. If you have a leak in the location of the strainer, drain the fuel tank, remove the strainer, and replace the seal using the appropriate steps of this procedure.

First, check the fuel level on the gauge to determine approximately how much fuel is in the tank. If your fuel level gauge is not working or you have reason to believe it is inaccurate, assume that the tank is full and have enough contains on hand to drain approximately 20 gallons of fuel from the tank. 2. Disconnect the battery negative lead. 3. Raise the rear of the vehicle using a floor jack. For safety, it's best to place the rear of the vehicle on jack stands once you have it raised. 4. If the vehicle is equipped with a cover for the fuel pump (at the bottom of the fuel tank) remove the fuel pump cover. The cover will have a strap holding it to the bottom of the fuel tank and a single bolt (13 mm head) near the wheel well. 5. Locate the fuel line going from the bottom of the fuel tank to the suction of the fuel pump and pinch the rubber fuel line using a hose clamp (as shown below). Page 2 of 5 6. Using a flat tip screwdriver, loosen the hose clamp at the fuel pump suction and disconnect the hose from the pump. Be ready with a container to catch any fuel which will drain from the fuel line and fuel pump. Also, have some catch rags on hand to clean up any fuel that might spill from the lines. 7. Place a container under the fuel line and loosen the hose clamp to start draining the fuel from the tank. When the container is full, pinch the line once again with the hose clamp to stop the flow of fuel until you can replace the full container with an empty container. Repeat this process until all of the fuel is drained from the tank. If you use containers which are clean to begin with and keep them clean by covering the container when it's full of fuel, you'll be able to reuse the fuel when the job is complete. 8. Once the tank is completely drained, using a flat tip screwdriver, loosen the hose clamp and the fuel tank outlet and remove the hose from the tank outlet nozzle. 9. You'll notice that the tank outlet is a larger round cover with a nozzle coming out of it. At the base of the nozzle (which you can't see too well with the hose attached), there is a hex head that's part of the nozzle. Page 3 of 5 10. Using a 17 mm deep socket and ratchet or 17 mm wrench on the hex of the nozzle, turn counter-clockwise to remove the nozzle and strainer assembly. Make sure you have a container underneath the tank. The bottom of the strainer assembly is below the level of the nozzle so, some additional fuel (a small amount) will drain from the tank when the strainer is removed. 11. When you get the strainer out, inspect the strainer for debris built up on the outside of the screen. You can see from the picture below that this particular strainer is very clean. You may find some debris at the base of the strainer (second picture below) which may be cleaned out using a small probe. However, be careful not to poke a hole in the strainer while you're cleaning that area. Page 4 of 5 12. You may clean the strainer if it is clogged by backflushing fuel or carburetor and choke cleaner back through the nozzle. You may also blow low pressure (10 psig max) air back through the strainer nozzle to loosen debris from the screen. If you discover any holes in the screen during cleaning, the strainer should be replaced. 13. Install a new O-ring seal on the strainer. Coat the seal with a small amount of moly grease to lubricate the seal. This will keep it from binding and getting cut or abraded during installation. 14. Install strainer and tighten using 17mm wrench or deep socket. 15. Attach the fuel line to the strainer nozzle and fuel pump and tighten hose clamps. 16. Refill the fuel tank and check the strainer assembly and fuel lines for leaks. 17. Install the fuel pump cover (if equipped). 18. Remove vehicle from jack / jack stands.

When this happens, the fuel rail voids and the car is difficult to start when it's been sitting for a while. When the engine is turned over, if the fuel rail is voided, it takes the fuel pump a while to refill and clear the voids from the rail so that the car will get enough fuel to start. Normally, if fuel rail voiding is caused by a leaking injector, you'll see lots of black smoke on subsequent startups. The following guide is intended to help you isolate fuel system leakdown problems. Tools · · · · · · Metric Wrench Set Metric Socket Set Hose Clamping Tool Fuel Pressure Gauge and (if necessary) adapter for fuel rail DME/Fuel Pump relay jumper Catch rags Test 1. Using FUEL-01, connect a fuel pressure gauge and install a DME/Fuel pump relay jumper to pressurize the fuel rail to normal operating pressure. 2. With the fuel system operating at normal pressure, remove the DME/Fuel pump relay jumper to stop the fuel pump. 3. Immediately install a hose clamping device on the rubber portion of the fuel line downstream of the Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR). If you are unsure of the FPR location, see FUEL-07 for pictures showing FPR locations. Note the fuel pressure and the time that you installed the hose clamp. This is the start time for the leakdown test. 4. After 20 minutes, note the fuel pressure and compare it to the specified value in FUEL-01. If you're performing this procedure due to a failed leakdown test, also compare the pressure to the failed leakdown test pressure. If this pressure still fails the leakdown test, then the source of the leakage is not the FPR and you should proceed to the next step. If the pressure results in a successful leakdown test (assuming it was failing leakdown tests before), then the FPR is leaking and needs to be replaced. 5. Remove the hose clamp from the FPR regulator line. 6. Install the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to start the fuel pump and pressurize the fuel system. Page 1 of 2 7. With the fuel system pressurized, remove the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to stop the fuel pump. 8. Immediately install a hose clamping device on the rubber portion of the fuel line upstream of the Fuel Dampener. If you are unsure of the Fuel Dampener location, see FUEL-07 for pictures showing FPR locations. The Fuel Dampener looks almost identical to the FPR and is located either adjacent to the FPR on the fuel rail or at the opposite end of the fuel rail from the FPR. Note the fuel pressure and the time that you installed the hose clamp. This is the start time for the leakdown test. 9. After 20 minutes, note the fuel pressure and compare it to the specified value in FUEL-01. If you're performing this procedure due to a failed leakdown test, also compare the pressure to the failed leakdown test pressure. If this pressure still fails the leakdown test, then the source of the leakage is not the Fuel Dampener and you should proceed to the next step. If the pressure results in a successful leakdown test (assuming it was failing leakdown tests before), then the fuel pump check valve is leaking and needs to be replaced. The fuel pump check valve is threaded into the inlet of the fuel pump. 10. If the source of the fuel system leakdown is not the FPR or the Fuel Dampener, then it is most likely a leaking fuel injector. 11. To determine which injector is leaking, remove the fuel rail with the injectors still attached. This may will likely require you to disconnect the fuel rail supply and return lines. 12. One you have the fuel rail removed from the intake manifold (i.e. so you can see the tips of the injectors), reconnect the fuel supply and return lines to the rail. 13. Place catch rags under each injector tip. 14. Install the DME/Fuel Pump Relay jumper to start the fuel pump and note which injector(s) is leaking. Replace or refurbish as necessary.

To do this, the gauge must be slid out of the dash enough to get your hand behind the cluster to unscrew the cable connection. By pushing all of the slack in the speedometer cable from the engine compartment through the dash into the passenger's compartment, you may be able to slid the gauges out enough to disconnect the cable. However, if this does not work, you'll have to remove the turn signal assembly to get enough room to disconnect the cable. Tools · · · Phillips head screwdriver 24 mm socket (or 15/16&quot;) and ratchet Scribe, paint pen, or brightly colored nail polish Procedure 1. Remove the horn button from the steering wheel and disconnect the electrical spade connector on the back of the horn button. 2. Using a 24 mm (or 15/16&quot;) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and washer. 3. Using a scribe, paint pen, or nail polish, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the end of the steering shaft. This will facilitate easier installation during reassembly. 4. Pull the steering wheel off the steering shaft. 5. Remove the two Phillips head screws located in the outer to gauge pods. 6. In the engine compartment, locate the speedometer cable and push as much of the slack in the cable through the firewall into the passenger's compartment. 7. Slide the gauge assembly as far out as possible, reach behind the assembly, and unscrew the speedometer cable. 8. If the gauges will not slide out enough to unscrew the speedometer cable, remove the turn signal switch assembly as follows: a. Remove the two screws holding the upper and lower steering column covers in place and remove the covers. The lower cover will come off easily. However, the upper cover will requires some wiggling to remove. Be careful when removing the covers as they are easily broken. b. Disconnect the electrical connectors for the turn signal switch assembly. c. Remove the three screws from the face of the turn signal switch assembly and remove the assembly from the steering shaft. d. You should now be able to move one side of the gauge cluster out far enough to get your hand behind the assembly and unscrew the speedometer cable. Page 1 of 2 9. Once the speedometer cable is disconnected, slide the gauges out far enough to disconnect all the wires attached to the back of the gauges and then remove the cluster from the dash. 10.

Remove the screws and slide the cluster forward to access the electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. 10. Slide the cluster forward enough to reach the electrical plug connectors on the back of the cluster. Be extremely careful when moving the cluster around and removing it. There is a ribbon circuit board on the back which can easily hang on the edges of the openings in the dash and tear (don't ask how I know). There are three electrical connectors on the back of the cluster. Each has a set of locking levers that hold the plug connector onto the back of the cluster.

Dave has also included information on how the motor circuits in later 944s differ from those of the early cars. However, the theory of operation and repair methods remain the same. I've added a few notes along the way and a different circuit diagram (with Dave's approval). We plan to expand this procedure down the road to describe how the entire exterior lighting circuit works in detail. But first, I have to figure out exactly how the bridge adapter in the later model 944 works. I'd like to thank Dave for his valuable contribution to Clark's Garage. Clark Fletcher Foreword by the Author My 944 had been reclaimed from an insurance company following a vandalism claim. The car had gone to a yard where some parts had been sold from it. In the process, the wiring harness had been cut in the front of the car and the headlight motor had been sold. When I purchased the car, the headlight motor in it had come from another wreck and was not connected. The internal circuit under the relay block had been rewired incorrectly. Finally, the mechanical headlight linkage was binding and several of the cap screws were loose. Surprisingly, most of the car was fine. So far, I have rebuilt all of the brake calipers, resurfaced or replaced all of the rotors, repacked the CV joints, fixed a number of electrical problems and cured some ills in the cooling system. I have learned that one of the most important things about the 944 is the assortment of clips and clamps that hold the various tubes, wires and hoses in place. When I got the car, the top rad hose was not clamped in place. One result was the circular-saw effect that had been applied by the alternator pulley to the hose. Cars that have seen work done by a number of different people may be subject to sloppiness in the area of what appears to be unimportant details. I'm resigned to the fact that, if I want a reliable car, the details must be identical to the way they were when the car left the factory. All told, I am enjoying working through the various systems of the 944, checking and rebuilding them. The car is different and my work has been an education. I have strived to do every task, by the book. Restoring the car's performance and reliability is my aim. David Simms, Kamloops, BC, Canada Page 1 of 7 1983-84 Porsche 944 Headlight Motor Circuit, Operation and Repair Components · · · · · · · Motor Worm gear / Rotary Switch : This switch has three brushes which ride on a conducting disk. The inner brush has a cut-out that interrupts the current when the headlights have reached the off position. The center brush has an uninterrupted path. The outside brush has a cut-out that interrupts the current when the headlights have reached the on position. Relay This normally-off relay controls the motor. Uses Red/Blue conductor. Four Conductors: Control wires :Grey, Red/Green. Supply wire :Red/Blue. Ground Wire : Brown. S1 Normally-on switch, controlled by the headlight dash switch. Uses Red/Green conductor. S2 Normally-off switch, same as above. Uses Grey conductor. Dash Light Switch controls S1 and S2. Page 2 of 7 Theory of Operation · · Initially, the ignition switch is on and the headlights are off. S1 is closed and the red/green conductor has 12 volts on it. The inner brush of the rotary switch resides on its cut-out. No current flows to the relay coil. The dash headlight switch is turned to on. Switch S1 is turned off (no effect). S2 is turned on, the grey conductor goes from zero to 12 volts. The outside brush on the rotary switch allows current to energize the relay coil. The relay closes the contact allowing current to flow along Red/Blue to the motor. The motor operates until the outside brush in the rotary switch meets its cut-out. Current to the relay is now interrupted. The motor turns off. The headlights are now in their on position. NOTE The first position on the headlight switch turns on the parking and license plate lights. The second position on the switch turns on the headlights and energizes the concealing motor to raise the headlights. C.F. · · · · · · The grey conductor still has 12 volts and the Red/green one has 0 volts. The dash headlight switch is now turned to the off position. S2 opens and S1 closes. The grey conductor goes to 0 volts, the Red/green one to 12 volts. The inner brush on the rotary switch energizes the relay coil. The motor operates until the inner brush touches its cut-out, turning off the relay and the motor. The headlights are now in their off position. This completes one cycle of headlight motor operation. NOTE If you've ever tried to operate raise the headlights manually, you probably found that when you reached a certain point raising the headlights that they automatically went back down. That's because the headlight concealing motor energizes to both raise and lower the headlights. As you rotate the dial on the motor, you also move the rotary switch. With the S1 switch closed, when the rotary switch contact is made, the motor energizes and returns to the closed position. If you wish to raise the headlights manually, you must remove Fuse #1 on the auxiliary fuse panel for early 944s or Fuse #2 on the main fuse panel for later model 944s. C.F. Page 3 of 7 Notes Regarding the 1985 1/2 and more Recent Models Similarities & Differences Between Early/Late Models: · · · · · · · Basic principles of Operation are the Same The Grey control wire is now Yellow/Blue The control wires are now fused The Red/Green wire requires a 7.5 A fuse in holder no.16 The Yellow/Blue wire takes a 7.5 A fuse in holder no.37 The Red/Blue supply wire takes a 25 A fuse in holder no. 2 These fuses must be checked before undertaking any repairs Maintenance Suggestions · · · · If the car is new-to-you, check the fuse values: 16 amps in the no. 1 fuse holder on the Additional Fuse Box (Early 944s). For later cars, check the three fuses listed above. Turn the manual control knob on the headlight motor to take the system through one cycle, note any points of excessive resistance. Remember to remove the motor fuses before trying to cycle the motor manually. Try to locate where the rubbing occurs. It will probably occur where the headlight assembly passes through the bodywork. You may need to remove foreign material. Or, you may need to adjust the alignment of the linkage. Note the sheet metal tabs on either side of the car above the radiator. On each tab are three small cap screws. You can make small adjustments to the linkage here. Your car may have sustained front-end damage and folds in the body metal may be rubbing on the headlight housings as they change position. Consult a body man if this is preventing the proper operation of the headlight linkage. Grease the ball-joints in the linkage with lithium-based grease. Proper lubrication will make a surprising difference in the resistance encountered by the headlight concealing motor. Page 4 of 7 Repair Procedures · Headlights too low or too high Start the car. Turn on the headlights. Unscrew the linkage from the motor shaft without turning it. Reposition the headlights manually while holding the linkage that you just removed from the motor. Reconnect the linkage to the motor shaft. Try turning the headlights on / off once more to verify the correct position. Repeat the procedure, if necessary. · Headlights turn on but do not move Check Fuses. On the '85 1/2 and later models, the control wires are fused too. The headlight motor assembly will probably have to be removed from the car. First, disconnect the 4-pin connector to the motor.

If the voltages have the prescribed values, remove the motor assembly. The unit will have to be bench-tested. Bench-testing the motor unit · · Remove unit from car. o Disconnect motor shaft from linkage. o Remove four-pin electrical connector from motor assembly o Remove the three screws holding the unit to the car o Remove the rubber covers from the motor assembly Do a visual/electrical check of components o Check condition of the relay points. If they are burned, file the points or replace the relay. o Check continuity of relay coil with an ohmmeter. The wire is fine and can easily break. The resistance of the coil is about 65 Ohms. If there is no continuity, the relay will need to be replaced. o If the above checks out all right, remove the relay block from the motor. o Check the male and female connectors in the four-pin connector for damage. You may need to bring the unit to your local supplier to get compatible connectors if they are damaged. Page 5 of 7 o Check wiring of the relay block. terminals 1 & 3: To motor and Red/Blue. terminals 2 & 5: To the relay coil, from ground and center brush on rotary switch terminal 5: No connection. o Remove the rotary switch cover and check the brushes. If a brush is damaged, it can be removed by de-soldering it from the external wire. You may be able to get a replacement from an appliance repairman or to fashion one from a piece of flat brass. The amount of current flowing through these brushes is negligible if everything is working properly. Therefore, the construction of these brushes, apart from their length, is not critical. o Test the motor This is probably the least likely area of failure. Remove the motor relay from the relay block by prying gently with a screwdriver. Fit a spade-type female connector to a piece of wire and insert it into the relay side of terminal 1 or 3 (whichever will connect to the green motor wire). Connect the case of the motor to the negative terminal of a battery or battery charger and the other wire to the positive terminal. If the motor does not turn, look for a poor connection, otherwise, a new motor is required. Page 6 of 7 o Repairing the rubber boots. With time and temperature changes, the rubber boots protecting your headlight motor may have split along their seams. Clean and lightly sand the areas adjoining the split. Apply tape to the inside of the split so that the boot is held together. Apply several layers of automotive GOOP to the split, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next. Remove the tape and apply layers of GOOP to the inside of the split. Trim off any excess. Your boot should be able to withstand some vigorous stretching as it is put back on the motor.

While the cycling normally occurs going from the raised position to lower position, it can also occur going from the lowered position to the raised position. The electrical contact wheel provides a continuous electrical flow path for the headlight motor to keep it energized when the headlight switch is operated. The only exception is two small plastic inserts into the wheel which break the electrical contact at the full up position and at the full down position. Over time, corrosion builds up on the contact wheel. The corrosion gets carried by the contacts onto the normally non-conducting plastic inserts on the wheel. A film of corrosion eventually builds up on the inserts and they will conduct enough electricity to keep the motor energized and the headlights rotate up and down. To correct the problem, the headlight motor has to be removed, the gear assembly cover removed, and the contact wheel cleaned. The following procedure will provide step-bystep instructions for removing and cleaning the headlight motor. Tools · · · Metric Wrench / Socket Set Steel Wool, Emery Cloth, or Fine Grit Sandpaper (see procedure) Flat tip screwdriver Page 1 of 9 Headlight Motor Removal 1. Disconnect the battery. 2. Disconnect the headlight motor electrical plug and remove relay. 3. If the motor is equipped with a manual raising and lowering dial (some early cars are not), raise the headlight to the 1/2 to 3/4 raised position. This will make all of the motor mounting bolts easily accessible. 4. Remove the bottom two 10mm bolts that hold the motor to the mounting bracket. 5. Lower the headlights back to the full down position. This is done to retain the motor-to-linkage alignment when the motor is removed. Page 2 of 9 6. Remove the 13mm nut from the end of the drive shaft of the motor (that holds the headlight linkage to the motor shaft). 7. Remove the remaining (top) 10mm bolt that holds the motor to the bracket. 8. You'll probably have to use a flat tip screwdriver or pry bar to separate the linkage from the motor shaft. Once you're done remove the motor from the car. Page 3 of 9 Cleaning the Headlight Motor Assembly 1. This is probably the hardest part of the whole job. There's a rubber boot that covers the bottom of the motor and the gear housing that must be removed. Work it down off of the motor, around the bottom of the gear assembly, over the drive shaft in the back (that's the hard part), and finally off of the relay block. Work slowly and carefully and you can do this without damaging the boot. 2. There are six flat head screws that hold the gear assembly cover. However, you can only see five of them as one is under the relay block. As you remove the screws pay careful attention to the location of each screw as they are different lengths. In the pictures below, you'll see the location of the six screws and the size of the screws that go in each location by the numbers. Page 4 of 9 3. First remove the two screw that hold the relay block in place (one long, one short). Move the relay block out of the way and remove the screw underneath the block. Remove the remaining three screws. Page 5 of 9 4. Remove the gear assembly cover carefully as there are electrical contacts on the back side of the cover. Be careful when you remove the cover as there is a small ball bearing in the center of the contact wheel. Remove that ball bearing and set it to one side so you don't lose it. 5. Behind the cover, you'll find the contact wheel which will probably be pretty dirty. You'll see two plastic areas on the wheel and several plastic tabs which hold the wheel to the large gear behind it. Page 6 of 9 6. Clean the gear with steel wool, emery cloth, or fine grit sandpaper. My contact wheel was pretty dirty and steel wool didn't work too well. I recommend 440 grit sandpaper but, I had to use 220 grit paper because that's all I had. If you use 220 grit paper just sand lightly and don't get too aggressive. Blow all of the debris out of the gear assembly when you're done cleaning the wheel. 7. Install the gear assembly cover and relay block. Again, make sure that the different length screws are in their correct positions. 8. Here's the second hardest part of the job. Install the rubber boot back onto the motor assembly. Place the boot over the relay block first and then slowly work it over the gear assembly. The hardest part is getting the boot over the gear assembly drive shaft. The easiest way I've found to do this is to stick two fingers inside the boot as you're working it over the gear assembly, placing them on either side of the gear assembly shaft, and pull the boot up and over shaft. You'll have to do this several times to basically &quot;walk&quot; the boot until it reaches the shaft opening in the boot. Page 7 of 9 Headlight Motor Installation 1. Before installing the motor install the relay and electrical plug and set the motor somewhere (on top of the washer reservoir is a good spot) where the motor shaft isn't touching anything. Then temporarily reconnect the battery. This will reset the motor back to the fully lowered position in case it moved during cleaning. Then disconnect the battery and motor electrical plug and relay. Page 8 of 9 2. Install the motor back to the mounting bracket. Install the top 10mm bolt and the bottom front bolt (but do not fully tighten) without moving the linkage. The bottom one is tough but, this ensures that the motor is in proper alignment with the linkage. 3. Next, install the 13mm bolt that holds the linkage to the motor shaft and tighten. 4. Using the knob on top of the motor, rotate the headlights to the 1/2 to 3/4 raised position. This will facilitate installing the bottom rear motor mounting bolt (10mm). 5. Tighten all of the motor mounting bolts and lower the headlights to the full down position. 6. As a side note, during manipulation of the headlights, it's a very good time to lubricate the linkage. 7. Plug in the relay and motor electrical plug. 8. Reconnect the battery. 9. Test the headlights to make sure they are operating properly.

I'll try to describe them here and tell you what to look for to try and fix them. Full Heat at All Temperature Settings There are two problems which most commonly cause this condition. The first and most common problem is a damper linkage in the driver's side footwell (for left-hand drive cars). Stick your head in the footwell and look up and toward the center console. You should see a small diameter metal rod which rests in a white plastic support and is held in place by a metal retaining clip. On later model 944s, there are two damper linkages instead of one and they are located behind a plastic cover. One of the plastic clips on the linkage may be broken preventing the linkage from operating the damper. When the damper fails to operate, the system fails to full heat. Most German cars are designed to fail this way. It's a safety feature to keep you from freezing in winter. The first picture below shows a linkage that has come loose from the support because the metal clip is broken. The second picture show the linkage properly in place with a new support and clip along with the part numbers for the support and clip. Page 1 of 2 The second problem is with the heater control valve. The heater control valve is vacuum operated and located at the back of engine near the firewall. There is a vacuum line which goes from the valve to a vacuum connection at the firewall where the heater hose connections penetrate the firewall. Check this vacuum line to make sure it is connected and doesn't show any signs of cracking. There is another vacuum line fitting near the heater hose connections which goes to a rubber &quot;Y&quot; connector. One side of the &quot;Y&quot; goes to a small check valve attached to the large brake booster vacuum line at the back of the firewall. The other side of the &quot;Y&quot; goes through the firewall to a plastic vacuum retention canister next to the battery. Make sure all these lines are connected and don't show any signs of cracking. If all vacuum lines are properly connected you may wish to remove the heater control valve from the system and check it's operation with a vacuum tester. Intermittent Heat If your car's heater works fine while driving down the road but the air from the vents becomes cold at idle, you probably have air in the coolant system. Air pockets in the coolant system often accumulate in the heater core. At higher engine RPMs the coolant pump will develop enough discharge head to force some coolant through the heater core. However, at idle, the air pocket will keep coolant from flowing through the core. If you are experiencing these symptoms, vent the coolant system using the COOL-02, Coolant System Draining, Filling, and Venting.

Using BODY-09, remove the nose panel from the vehicle. NOTE When you remove the nose panel, you will find that the crest is held in place by two posts. The posts will be held by one of two different types of retaining nuts. One is a spring clip and the other is a screw-on type nut. The spring clips have a tendency to become loose over time and in the case of my own car resulted in the hood crest getting blown off on the interstate. The picture below show the back of a nose panel with retaining clips. When installing a new hood crest kit with retaining nuts these clips will have to be removed from the panel. Page 1 of 3 2. If the old crest to be removed is held in place by the spring clips, the crest must be removed by sliding a putty knife under the crest and prying it off of the nose panel. I really don't like doing this because there's a risk of damaging the paint. So, I typically use a plastic putty knife or simply cut the spring clips (since I'll be removing them anyway) away from the posts on the hood crest using a pair of end cutters. NOTE The new hood crest kit (shown below) will come with a hood crest, gasket, and two retaining nuts with a sealant putty on the back. It may be extremely difficult to get the gasket to remain fitted onto the hood crest properly while the crest is being installed. I advise stretching the gasket slightly before installing it onto the crest and apply a small amount of trim adhesive to hold the gasket onto the crest. 3. Install the gasket onto the hood crest. Place the crest on the nose panel and install the backing nuts. Do not full tighten the nuts yet. 4. It may still be impossible to keep the lip of the gasket fitted over the edges of the crest while it is being installed. So, it may be necessary to roll the lip of the gasket out from under the crest and around it's edges after the crest is installed onto the nose panel. Consequently, don't tighten the nuts for the hood crest until you're sure the gasket is correctly positioned on the crest. The picture below demonstrates how to roll the lip of the gasket using a straight probe. A small flat tip jeweler's screwdriver works very well also. Use caution when rolling the lip on the gasket so as not to damage it. Page 2 of 3 5. Once the gasket is in place around the outside edge of the hood crest, tighten the backing nuts until they are snug. Do not over tighten the nuts as it will squeeze out all of the sealing putty.

Turn off the fan motor and AC Compressor during idle adjustment. 2. Start the vehicle and allow it to idle to warm up the engine. The factory manual specifies performing the idle adjustment with the engine oil temperature between 70 - 90 °C (158 - 194 °F). The factory measuring device uses a probe which inserts into the oil dipstick tube. Since most of us can't justify investing in the factory measuring device, we have to come up with some other method of determining the oil temperature. Personally, I use a contact temperature gauge and measure the temperature on the bottom of the oil pan. If you wish to try the idle adjustment without measuring the oil temperature, run the engine for about 10 minutes after the coolant is at normal operating temperature. 3. For '85½ and newer models defeat the operation of the idle stabilizer by installing the jumper between terminals B and C of the diagnostic plug (see diagram). If you happen to have Special Tool 9246 (Test Relay), it can be used instead of the wire jumper to defeat the idle stabilizer. The idle stabilizer is not operating when the green lamp on the test relay is lit. Page 1 of 3 4.

I'd like to thank Dean for taking the time to write such a complete, detailed procedure. He also took the time to document the replacement with pictures. It will make your ignition switch replacement a breeze. Foreword by Author I was having starting problems that were driving me crazy. I re-soldered the DME, replaced the coil, and checked the speed and reference sensors. Everything was ok. Finally I located the problem. With the ignition switch and its associated mounting out of the car, it would start no problem. As soon as I install it in the car it would not work. Closer inspection of the switch revealed that it was cracked . These are a couple of photos of the broken switch. Crack in the side of Ignition Switch Looking at front of the Switch Back of the switch Page 1 of 20 The following is a basic set of instructions and photos from my 1987 924s. This car does not have air bags and I have a Dino Wheel so your car may be different. Ok lets get started. First off you will be dealing with allot of little screws. Make sure that you have a container to put them in as you take things apart. It is also important to lay things out in order as you remove then as it is easy to leave something out during the reassembly Dean Smith Tools that you will need: · · · · · · · · · Phillips screwdriver #1 Tip (smallest of the standard sizes) Metric Allen wrench set Couple of various sized flat screwdrivers Small pry-bar Hammer Brass drft or large deep dish socket Small scribe or small coal chizzes to mark location of the wheel relative to the steering column You may need a Steering wheel puller Good Shop Light Lets Get Started Here is my steering wheel. Note that it is centered and double check that the wheels are strait. Page 2 of 20 Here is a couple of photos of the left and right sides. Page 3 of 20 1. To remove my wheel I have to take the six Allen bolts out in the center of the wheel. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL. Refer to BODY-25, Steering Wheel Removal and Installation for more information on steering wheel removal. 2. Once the wheel is free you have to disconnect the wires for the horn. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL Page 4 of 20 3. Next remove the rubber boot from around the adaptor/crush zone.THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL Page 5 of 20 4. On my set up there is a marking for where the &quot;TOP&quot; should be. If you have not done it already make sure your wheel is centered. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL 5. Next remove the center nut. This may requite some muscle Mine comes off rather easy. I put a large screwdriver through the adaptor bracket and hold it while I take the nut off with a socket. Take the nut and washer of but DON'T TAKE THE ADAPTOR / WHEEL OFF YET. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL. Page 6 of 20 6. Once the nut and washer are off you have to scribe the shaft and the adaptor. On the stock wheel you will be scribing the wheel. The mark on the adaptor is hard to see but it is there. Note the mark on the steering column. 7. Once you mark or index the parts you can continue taking it apart. Slide the steering wheel or steering wheel adapter off of the steering column. Page 7 of 20 8. Now you are looking at the top of the switches / stalks. Remove the three flat head screws on top of the stalk. 9. Now that you have removed the screws the stalks will be loose. You now have to remove the plastic housing around the stalks. It splits longitudinally and is held in place with two screws that are from below. The reason I did not remove this first is it is easier with the wheel removed and with the stalks loose it is easier to remove the plastic pieces. Here are a couple of photos showing the screw locations looking up from below. Page 8 of 20 Here is a photo of the two screws. Note that they are two different sizes. 10. Now it is time to CAREFULLY slide the stalks off the column. There are a bunch of wires connected to the switches. In my car I don't have to remove them. I carefully pull them forward from underneath as I gently pull on the switches out. You will also note that the two stalks / switches can separate from each other. If this happens it is ok. Just carefully continue to pull/guide the wires out until the switch clearers the steering column. Repeat the process with the second one. If the two switches came apart I then CAREFULLY put the two switches back together once they are removed. The following photo shows the top switch removed. Page 9 of 20 This photo shows the bottom switch removed. Both switches removed and reassembled. Note that I still have the wires attached. You could remove the wires but I prefer to do it this way because if you forget to hook up a wire that happens to pull back through the dash it will be a real pain to attach it after you put it all back together. Page 10 of 20 Another photo of the two switches. Page 11 of 20 11. This is what you should now have left. Note the three little holes that are where the three screws went that hold the switches. These can be broken off very easily. DO NOT PRY/LEAN or hang anything from these. If you brake any of these you will have to replace the whole piece. A couple of other things to note ate the bearings around the column and the Allen head bolt that is visible on the left side of the column. Page 12 of 20 12. Here is another photo from the side. The next thing to remove is the plastic spacer collar that is around the steering column. To get this off I pry gently but firmly in the slots around the bottom. Once it moves a little I switch to a small pry bar that is thicker and wider than my largest screwdriver and carefully work it off. DO NOT PRY ON ANY OF THE THREE SMALL SCREW HOLE'S AS THEY WILL BRAKE OFF. The piece that my screwdriver is touching is the spacer collar. Page 13 of 20 The piece removed. 13. Now you have to remove the Allen head bolt on the left side of the column. Page 14 of 20 You get at this through a whole in the bottom of the dash. 14. With this bolt removed the asemble with the ignition switch will slide out. Note that there are a bunch of wires attached to the back of the switch. Page 15 of 20 15. Unplug the wires from the back of the ignition switch. Now flip the piece over and look at the back where the wires were plugged in and you will see a small Phillips screw. Remove this and the switch will slide out. Page 16 of 20 Here is the unit with the screw removed. 16. You can then slide the switch out. Page 17 of 20 17. On my new switch I put some grease on the end of the switch where the tang from the lock engages as this will see a lot of wear. 18. You are now ready start the reassembly. I will not cover the whole thing just a couple of highlights. When I put the bracket back I packed the bearings with fresh grease. Page 18 of 20 The plastic ring/spacer will get some burs on it. I lightly sanded / filed them off before I reinstalled it. I also put a light coating of grease inside to aid in it slipping back on. When reinstalling this do not use a screwdriver and a hammer to tap it in place. It will damage the plastic or even split it. I use a large deep socket and tap on it alternating forum side to side. When I install the plastic trim pieces I again do this with the switches in place but not screwed in place. this will give you a little play when you put the trim pieces back on. In the following photo you will se how I place the top trim piece. I then push it down and back in place. It should just snap in place. Page 19 of 20 Well that about covers it. I hope this helps.

If so, you should have already verified that you actually have a no spark condition by performing the initial &quot;no spark&quot; test described in TS-01, Troubleshooting Engine Will Not Start. There are many different ways to go about testing for a no spark condition. The only problem in determining the ultimate cause of a no spark condition is that if the condition is caused by a problem with the DME computer, there's really no way to conclusively test the DME. The same is true with a no fuel condition. So, what we have to do is determine, as best we can, whether the DME is getting power and whether it's getting all of the correct input signals it requires to run the engine. If we get all of the proper inputs and the DME is still not providing the desired output (i.e. spark from the ignition coil or running the fuel pump), we make the assumption that the DME computer is bad and we replace it. One of the best ways to test the DME computer is to swap it for a known good DME computer. However, most of us don't have the luxury of keeping a spare DME computer on hand. However, if you suspect that starting or running problem may be due to a bad DME computer, try to borrow a computer to test your car before running out and buying a DME.

Grasp the distributor cap and attempt to move it back and forth. If it moves easily, the retaining screws are not properly engaged or the distributor cap gasket is compressed and needs to be replaced. 2. Using IGN-01, remove the distributor cap. 3. Inspect the distributor cap for the following and replace as necessary: a. Cracks b. Carbon tracking c. Moisture buildup on inside of cap d. Debris e. Worn rotor button f. Pitted, worn, or charred terminals 4. Inspect the rotor for charring or pitting and replace if necessary. 5. Check the rotor retaining screw is in place. These screws have a tendency to fall out causing the rotor to become misaligned. 6. Ensure the dust cover is securely in place behind the rotor. This dust cover is important because it keeps debris from the belt housing area from getting into the distributor cap and causing poor or non-existent spark. Ignition Coil Test 1. Disconnect the ignition coil output wire at the distributor cap. 2. Connect a spark plug to the end of the ignition coil output wire which you just disconnected. 3. Connect a ground wire to the threaded portion of the spark plug. 4. Disconnect the ignition coil ground wire from the negative terminal on the coil (Green Wire). 5. Connect one end of a ground wire to the ignition coil negative terminal. 6. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. 7. Tap the other end of the ignition coil ground wire jumper on an good grounding point (for example the battery negative terminal) and look for sparks at the spark plug that correspond to the frequency of your tapping of the ground wire. 8. If you have a good spark at the spark plug, the ignition coil is good. 9. If you don't get a good spark, check for approximately 12 VDC from the coil positive terminal (black wire) to ground with the ignition switch in the ON position. You should also get approximately 12 VDC from the coil negative terminal (Green wire) to ground Page 2 of 3 Ignition Coil Resistance Check In addition to the test above, you may elect to perform an ignition coil resistance check as confirmation of the coil's condition. 1. Check the ignition coil primary coil resistance by connecting an ohmmeter between the positive (Black wire) and negative (Green wire) terminals on the coil. The resistance should be 0.4 to 0.6 ohms. 2. Check the ignition coil secondary coil resistance by connecting an ohmmeter between the coil output terminal and the ignition coil negative terminal. The resistance should be 5000 to 7200 ohms.

Checks Comments Fuel Pump Fuse Pre-1985.5 944s - Fuse #2 on Auxiliary Fuse Panel 1985.5 and Newer 944s and 968s - Fuse #34 on Central Electric Panel Bypass Power to Fuel Pump Remove Fuel Pump / DME relay and install jumper to bypass the Fuel Pump / DME relay and DME computer and directly power the fuel pump. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 30 to Terminal 87b If the fuel pump starts, it indicates that the fuel pump, power supply to the fuel pump, and wiring from the relay panel to the fuel pump are good. Therefore, the problem lies in the fuel pump / DME relay, the DME computer, or loss of the signals to the DME computer which cause the fuel pump to start or remaining running after it starts. If that is the case, continue troubleshooting with the next check. If the fuel pump does not start, use an external 12 VDC power source to apply power directly to the fuel pump. If the fuel pump starts, check the wiring from the relay panel to the fuel pump and perform the Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Supply Voltage check. If the fuel pump does not start with power supplied directly at the pump, the fuel pump is bad and should be replaced. Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Supply Voltage Remove the Fuel Pump / DME Relay and check for supply voltage (approximately 12 VDC) from the battery. Insert a male spade connector into the relay board terminal to make checking the voltage easier. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 30 If no voltage is present, the battery is dead or the wire from the battery to the relay panel is broken / disconnected. Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Primary Coil Voltage Remove the fuel pump / DME relay, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;run&quot; position, and check for approximately 12 VDC at the relay primary coil terminal. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 86 If no voltage is present, the ignition switch is bad, there is a problem with the alarm system (if equipped), or there is a broken wire between the battery and ignition switch, between the ignition switch and alarm module (if equipped), or between the alarm module and fuel pump / DME relay. If equipped with an alarm system, bypass the alarm system using ELECT-23, and repeat the test. If primary coil voltage is present, turn the ignition key off, install the Fuel Pump / DME relay and proceed to the next test. Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Coil Activation Disconnect the plug from the DME Computer. Turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position and check for supply voltage (approximately 12 VDC) from the Fuel Pump / DME Relay to the DME computer electrical connector. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 18 to Ground and Terminal 35 to Ground Engine Cranking / Running Signals For the fuel pump to start and remain running, for the ignition coil to develop secondary voltage, and for the injectors to fire, the DME computer must see an engine start signal or an engine running signal (greater than 200 RPM). When it does, it completes the circuit for the Fuel Pump / DME Relay secondary coil and the fuel pump starts. It also provides a ground or current flow path for the ignition coil primary and secondary coils. As a result, the current flow through the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. The voltage across the secondary coil is what is seen at the distributor. The engine cranking / running signal also goes to the injector drivers (2) which provide a ground or current flow path for the fuel injectors to open. The injectors are batch fired which means that two injectors are fired together. On 944s, injectors 1 and 2 are fired together and injectors 3 and 4 are fired together. The engine start signal is normally generated by a combination of voltage from the ignition switch to the starter solenoid and a signal from the reference sensor. However, if the starter solenoid signal is not present, an engine cranking signal can be generated by the combination of the speed sensor and reference sensor signals. If all of the previous tests have been completed satisfactorily, check for cranking signal inputs as described in the following steps. Speed Sensor Using an oscilloscope, check the speed sensor output from terminals 8 and 27 on the DME Computer plug. You should get a signal of &gt; 2.5 V. The speed sensor generates an engine speed signal by counting the teeth on the flywheel ring gear. It produces two output pulses for each ring gear tooth. If you don't have an oscilloscope, you can still check the speed sensor by doing a resistance check. Check for 600-1600 ohms between terminals 8 and 27 on the sensor connector. Also, check for infinite resistance between terminals 27 and 23. Reference Sensor Using an oscilloscope, check the speed sensor output from terminals 25 and 26 on the DME Computer plug. You should get a signal of &gt; 2.0 V. The reference sensor generates an signal relative to engine position at TDC. It produces a single pulse triggered from a bolt cemented in the flywheel. If you don't have an oscilloscope, you can still check the speed sensor by doing a resistance check. Check for 600-1600 ohms between terminals 25 and 26 on the sensor connector. Also, check for infinite resistance between terminals 26 and 78. Starter Solenoid Signal Turn the ignition switch OFF. Disconnect the DME computer plug. Connect a DC voltmeter from terminal 4 on the DME plug to ground. Attempt to crank the vehicle and check for approximately 12 VDC on the voltmeter. If no voltage is present, the ignition switch is bad or the wire from the ignition switch to the DME computer is broken. To check the wire, check the resistance from terminal 50 on the ignition switch electrical plug to terminal 4 on the DME plug. DME Computer Checks DME computer The best way to test for a faulty DME computer is to swap it out with a known good DME computer. Now, most of us don't have the luxury of keeping a spare DME computer sitting around on the shelf. However, if you can borrow a DME computer from a friend for testing that's the best test for the DME. Just realize that you can't test an early 944 (pre-1985.5) using a DME computer from a later car or vice versa. They use different injectors. A later DME will not fire early injectors at all. An early DME MAY fire the injectors in a later car but, the current draw will be excessive and you could potentially damage the DMEs injector drivers. Even if you don't damage the injector drivers, they will likely shut down after a few cycles due to the excessive current draw. Other than that, there's actually very little that can be done to check the operation of the DME computer. However, about the only time a 944 DME computer fails is when it's had water intrusion due to a leaking battery tray or if it has bad solder joints which are easily repairable. If you are having trouble getting the car to start and you suspect the DME computer may be the cause, you can sometimes get the car to start by tapping on the outside of the DME computer case with a rubber mallet. If you suspect the DME computer is causing problems, remove the DME computer from the car and inspect for broken solder joints. When you open the DME computer, you'll find two circuit boards mounted face-to-face inside the box. At one end, the two circuit boards are bridge together by a ribbon cable and at the other they're plugged into the main plug terminal. You'll need to separate the two circuit boards, slide one of the boards out of the connector, and lay the boards open (like a book) to inspect the solder joints. For instructions on how to do this, refer to the appropriate sections of DME-02, DME Control Unit Chip Installation (Including KLR Chip for Turbos). When you inspect the DME for bad solder joints, pay particular attention to the solder joints where the ribbon cable joint the two circuit boards. Those tend to be a common source or problems. Other Fuel Related Problems Symptoms Possible Cause Checks Good fuel pressure but no fuel to engine. Injectors Not Firing Crank engine while listening for clicking from injectors. Injectors should fire twice for each revolution of the engine. Good fuel pressure at fuel rail but injectors not firing. No voltage to injectors. Perform the following to check for fuel injector supply voltage: Disconnect on fuel injector plug. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. Check for approximately 12 VDC on the injector plug terminals. There will be 12 VDC on one plug terminal and 0 VDC on the other terminal. Injector firing signal not present. Perform checks of Speed Sensor, Reference Sensor, and Starter Solenoid Signal described in the Fuel Pump troubleshooting section. Fuel Pressure too high. When the fuel pressure runs too high, the fuel injectors draw too much current causing the injector drivers in the DME computer to shut down. Disconnect on fuel injector connector and attempt to crank the engine. If the engine starts, where it would not start with all injector leads connected, the fuel pressure regulator is bad and should be replaced. Disconnecting one fuel injector plug reduces the injector driver current sufficiently to get the injector drivers to fire. Fuel Pressure Low Clogged Fuel Filter. If you don't know or can't verify the last time the fuel filter was changed, it's probably a good idea to replace the filter. Fuel Pump check valve stuck. Not a normal problem with low fuel pressure. Normally associated with fuel system depressurizing after shutdown as the typically stick open. However, if the car hasn't been run for an extended period of time, the check valve can get stuck closed. New fuel pumps normally come with a new check valve. Replace check valve. Fuel Pump bad. Perform fuel pump delivery rate check. ( FUEL-04) This assumes that the fuel filter and check valve are good.

Primarily for late model 944 owners (1985.5 and newer). The most common misconception is that Porsche simply didn't put bright enough bulbs in the instruments. That may be partially true. According to the Porsche PET, the bulbs are 12 VDC, 3 watt bulbs. However, I've never seen any bulbs come out of a cluster that were anything but 12V 2 watt bulbs. There are a wide range of higher wattage bulbs available for the late model gauge clusters. However, for the early 944 gauge which us a #37 bulb, there aren't really any options. Quite often, late model 944 owners will attempt to alleviate their low light problem by installing the largest wattage bulb they can find (typically 4-5 watts). It doesn't take long to figure out that this course of action by itself is a mistake. The 4-5 watt bulbs draw too much power. So, the bulbs tend to overheat and burn out very quickly. The other problem here is that the higher wattage bulbs produce so much heat that they will melt the bulb holders. Consequently, the largest wattage bulb that should be used in the 944 instrument panel is in the 3-4 watt range. See the table below for bulb recommendations. Now, going to a larger 3-4 watt bulb alone may not provide a significant improvement in illumination. The other problem that occurs with the dash lighting is related to the individual bulb holders. The instrument bulb holders are clear and are coated on the outside with a silver reflective material which intensifies the light from the bulb. Over time, this coating tends to flake and peel off the outside of the bulb housing or get scraped off if the cluster has been removed causing degraded instrument illumination. To fix this problem, you need to remove all of the old reflective material from the outside of the bulb housing and replace it with some type of new material. If your housing is not scratched or flaking, a bulb change may be all you need to fix your illumination problem. Page 1 of 5 If you find that your bulb holder reflective surface is scratched or peeling and you don't want to try and fix it yourself, you can order a new lens assembly. 944Online.com (http://www.944online.com) sells the assembly in their new parts section (approximately $99 plus shipping). If you have a Porsche dealership close by, the part number is 944 641 941 01. The current price at the Porsche dealer (08-15-05) is $95.12 USD and if you pick up at the dealership there's no shipping. To determine if your gauge cluster lens assembly is damaged, you'll first need to remove the instrument cluster from the dash (Early Cluster Removal or Late Cluster Removal).To remove the old reflective material from the bulb housing, DO NOT attempt to remove the reflective assemblies from the lens housing. I did however, removed the lens assembly from the instrument cluster to prevent damaging the gauges while cleaning the bulb holders. There are nine (9) Phillips head screws on the back of the assembly which hold the lens assembly to the instrument cluster. Page 2 of 5 Use some type of solvent to remove the reflective material but, do not use anything that will damage the plastic housing. I used non-acetone finger nail polish remover which worked very well. You might also try model paint thinner. If the coating is peeling badly you may be able to peel the coating off with an exacto-knife. However, I don't recommend it. Do not sand the material off as it will scratch the surface of the housing and adversely affect the reflective ability of the new coating. The pictures below show the process of removing the old reflective coating (nail polish remover and paper towel) and the After the old coating is removed from the housing, apply a new coating to the housing. Several things have been suggested for use as a new coating. The most common is aluminum foil attached to the housing with double-sided clear tape or clear adhesive. Another suggestion was to paint the outside of the housing with silver or chrome model paint. Personally, I tried painting the housings with silver metallic enamel first which did not work well at all. So, I removed the paint and used aluminum foil (shiny side toward the housing). This worked much better. I didn't have any double-sided clear tape or appropriate adhesive so, I simply taped the foil to the housing using masking tape. Down Page 3 of 5 the road, I'll probably go back and use double-sided clear tape. However, it's still a good idea to tape over the back of the foil to protect it and keep it from getting torn. As a side note, I am personally using the Sylvania 194 bulbs (3.78 watts). Along with refurbishing the bulb holder coverings, this provides a good improvement in illumination. Originally, I tried a Sylvania 161 bulb (2.66 watts) as that is what comes installed in aftermarket Autometer gauges and I wanted to have the same level of illumination from all my gauges. However, I found that the factory instrument cluster requires a higher wattage bulb to achieve the same level of illumination as the Sylvania 161 bulb in an Autometer gauge. The Sylvania 194 along with the bulb cover refurbishing gave (in my case) the same level of illumination. Depending on how well your refurbishing job is done (and mine wasn't done all that well), you may have to play around with different bulb wattages to get the same level of illumination as your aftermarket gauges. Also, if you decide to replace the lens assembly with a new assembly you'll likely be able to use a lower wattage bulb. I've provided some bulb recommendations below. However, there are many other bulb wattages available. Your local auto parts store (NAPA and CarQuest in particular) will have a book that contains a listing of all the bulbs and wattages available. The location of the bulb holders on the back of the cluster are shown below. Page 4 of 5 Bulb Recommendations Manufacturer Sylvania Bulb Number 158 Wattage 3.3 W Comments Recommended.

Apply a small amount of grease to the intake manifold gaskets to hold them in place and install the gaskets on to the cylinder head. NOTE Pay close attention to the orientation of the intake manifold gaskets when installing. On some cars, the gaskets are shaped identically but, must be oriented differently during installation. For example, on turbocharged cars, the #1 cylinder gasket orientation is not the same as the #2, #3, and #4 cylinders. While the gasket can be installed in the same orientation as the other cylinders and still fit, if done so, the gasket will partially block the injector flow path affecting the injector spray pattern. 3.

The primary jacking point is located at the center of the rocker panels as indicated by the diamond-shaped indent at the base of the rocker. This jacking point will raise both wheels on that side of the car of the ground at the same time. Several years ago, at someone's recommendation, I started using a solid rubber hockey puck between the jack pad and that jacking point which works very well. However, depending on the lowered height of your floor jack and the ride height of your car, you may not be able to slide the jack under the car with a hockey puck on top of the pad. In fact, if your car is low enough, you may have difficulty getting the floor jack under the rockers at all. If that is the case, you may be forced to roll the wheels on to boards to raise the vehicle enough for a floor jack. This center jacking point is the best place to raise the vehicle when placing it on jack stands. With regards to other jacking points, there are two round pads behind the front wheel wells that appear to be jacking points. I have used these points for years with great success. However, many 944 owners claim that these are not jacking points and have experienced bending of the floor pan when trying to use these points. You can use the points safely provided the load isn't concentrated too much on that jacking point or the pad on your jack doesn't contact the area around the pad at all. If you have a jack with an oversize pad area it will contact the area around that jacking point. However, if you use a small block of wood or hockey puck between the jacking point and the pad on the jack or jack stand will prevent the pad from contacting the area around the jacking point and will distribute the load more evenly across the pad. You can also place the jack or jack stand on the frame rail or on the front suspension cross member. However, if the cross-member is to be removed for maintenance or repairs the cross-member is not an option. The rear jacking points are along the bottom edge of the rocker panels just in front of the rear wheel wells. These points work well for most repairs. However, if the engine is to be removed, the car can become easily unbalanced and tilt toward the rear if these points are used. If the engine is to be removed it is better to place the jack stands on somewhere along the rear torsion tube assembly. On most vehicles there are also two round pads behind the rear wheels that may be used. However, unless you have a set of very tall jack stands, they may not provide enough height to work effectively under the vehicle. There are two other points behind the rear wheels on the frame rail that appear to be jacking points. However, I've never tried to use them and I'm not positive they exist on all 944 models. To place a 944 on jack stands: 1. Using a floor jack on the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels, raise one side of the vehicle to the desired height. 2. Place jack stands under the front and rear jacking points to be used on that side. 3. Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered. Use extreme caution as this is probably one of the most dangerous operations you will perform while working on your car. 4. Once the car is securely on the jack stands, lower the jack the rest of the way and move to the other side of the vehicle. 5. Again, using the center jacking point raise the vehicle to the desired height. Make sure that as the car is jacked it is balanced on the jack as it leaves the ground. 6. Place the jack stands into position under the jacking points to be used on that side of the vehicle. 7. Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered. 8. When the car is securely in position on the jack stands, the jack may be lowered the rest of the way. To remove a 944 from jack stands: 1. Raise the jack into position under the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels. 2. When the weight of the car is removed from the jack stands remove them from under the vehicle. 3. Very slowly, lower that side of the vehicle to the ground. Use extreme caution when lowering the vehicle. If it is lowered too quickly, you may dislodge it from the jack stands on the other side of the vehicle causing damage to the car or injuring yourself. 4. Move the jack to the other side of the vehicle and repeat.

The piece of plywood should be large enough to evenly distribute the weight of the engine over a good size area. I normally use a 12&quot; x 12&quot; piece of plywood. 12. Jack the engine up just enough to remove most of the weight from the motor mounts. 13. Loosen the cross-member mounting bolts (19 mm) until they are nearly removed. The easiest way to do this is to completely remove them one at a time and then thread them back in two turns. 14. Between jacking the engine up slightly and lowering the cross-member by loosening the cross-member bolts, this should give you enough room to slide the old motor mounts out. However, you may need to use a pry bar to raise one side of the engine enough to slide the old motor mount out and the new mount in. You will have to twist the mount to get it out as part of the mount inserts into a pocket in the side of the cross-member. 15. Before you install the new mounts, you may want to chase the threads in the mounting bolt holes of the new motor mounts with an M8 tap (i.e. retap the holes). In recent years there have been instances with OE mounts where the threads in the mounting bolt holes where not cut deep enough. This causes the threads in the holes to strip during mounting bolt installation. 16. The right side motor mount uses two of the M8 x 38 mm bolts and standard thickness washers. The old spacer washers (if your car still has them) are not used with the new style motor mounts. Install the right side mounting bolts and washers. 17. To determine the correct length bolt for the left side, measure the thickness of the ledge at the bottom of the left-side mounting bracket where the mounting bolt holes penetrate. If the ledge is 21 mm thick, you will need two 8 x M38 mm bolts. If the ledge is 25 mm thick, you will need two M8 x 42 mm bolts. Install the appropriate bolts with washers. The length of the bolts is important because if you use a bolt that is too long it will damage the new motor mount. 18. Installation is the reverse of removal. 19.

Regardless of what you call it, there are time that it may be necessary to remove it. The panel must be removed to replace the Porsche crest. On 944 Turbos, the panel must be removed to access the intercooler. And, on the 944 S2, the panel must be removed to replace the air filter. This procedure covers the removal and installation of the nose or header panel on 924s and 944s. On early model 944s, the nose panel is spot welded in place. To remove the nose panel on these cars, the spot welds must be drilled out. To reinstall the nose panel, it can be reattached using fasteners similar to the late model cars.

If so desired, you can raise the headlamps by removing the fuse listed above and raising the headlights manually using the knurled knob on top of the headlamp motor. 6. On the early 944s and early 924s, remove the header panel by drilling through all off the spot welds that hold the header panel to the body. 7. On late model 944s, remove the header panel as follows: a. Remove the four Phillips head screws along the back edge of the panel. Page 2 of 5 b. Loosen the retaining nuts (8mm) in the bottom of the headlight bucket (2 in each headlight bucket). The nuts do not have to be removed completely. They need only be loosened. c. There is a machine screw located under the front lip of the nose panel in each headlight bucket area. Page 3 of 5 d. Remove the machine screw under the lip of the nose panel using a 10mm socket, universal, 2 inch extension, and ratchet.

You should never do this. Make sure that the car comes to a complete stop before resetting the trip odometer. There is very little difference between early and late model gauges when it comes to odometer repair. The primary difference is the gauge removal itself and getting to the internals of the speedometer to repair the odometer. Where there are differences they will be discussed in the body of this procedure. Page 1 of 5 Procedure 1. Remove the instrument cluster as described in ELECT-07, &quot;Removing Late 944 (1985.5 and newer) Gauge Cluster&quot; OR ELECT-06, &quot;Removing Early 944 Gauges&quot; 2. For early model 944s (pre-1985.5) perform the following: a. Remove the speedometer from the instrument cluster by pushing on the back of the speedometer to push it out of the front of the cluster. b. Remove the bezel from the front of the speedometer by prying up on the bezel's back lip with a small flat tip screwdriver. Work around the circumference of the lip until the bezel is free from the unit. c. There are several screws on the back of the housing which need to be removed. Once they have been removed the speedometer internals will slide out of the housing. 3. For late model 944s (1985.5 or newer) perform the following: . Remove the gauge cluster front cover by removing the nine Phillips head screws located along the back edge of the cluster. a. Remove the four screws on the back of the instrument cluster directly behind the speedometer. This will allow you to remove the speedometer from the gauge cluster chassis. Page 2 of 5 4. From here on the repair for both early and late model cars is the same. 5. Hold the speedometer facing away from you and look at the left side for a worm gear. For those of you who don't know what a worm gear is, it looks like a white plastic screw. There should be a gear which engages this worm gear to drive the odometer. In all likelihood this gear has slid along the axis of it's shaft and has become disengaged from the worm gear, is worn to the point that it's teeth don't effectively engage the worm gear anymore, or is broken altogether. 6. If the gear has simply slid off the worm gear, use a small flat tip screwdriver to move it back along the shaft until it is engaged with the worm gear. place a drop of Crazy glue on the shaft where it penetrates the gear to keep it from sliding on the shaft in the future. 7. If your gear isn't broken or worn, you've completed the repair and may reassemble the gauge cluster. 8. If the gear is worn or broken, further disassembly of the speedometer is required to replace the gear. If you don't feel comfortable going further with the disassembly, you may send the speedometer off to have it repaired. I recommend sending it to North Hollywood Speedometer or you may contact VDO to find an authorized repair facility near you.

Apparently, you now have to go through one of their authorized repair facilities (i.e. NHS is an authorized repair facility). 9. If you wish to replace the gear yourself you'll first need to obtain a new gear. You may obtain a gear by contacting KLA Industries or Odometer Gears, Ltd. (see Parts section at beginning of procedure) or contacting an authorized VDO repair facility. You'll also find a very good gear replacement procedure with pictures on the KLA web site. Most 1985.5 and newer US model 944s use 20 x 21 tooth gear. However, in some instances you'll find they use a 20 x 22 tooth gear. Early US 944s use a 17 tooth gear and 968s use a 15 tooth gear.

However, a small number of 944s use a 20 x 22 tooth gear. You will have to disassemble the speedometer first to determine exactly which gear you need. If the gear has been destroyed to the point it is impossible to determine the number of gear teeth, you may have to purchase two gears and experiment with each to determine the correct gear for your particular car. 10. After you obtained the replacement gear, you'll need to disassemble the speedometer to replace the gear. 11. If the speedometer has a mechanical stop (pin) at 0 mph (early 944 gauges), gently lift up the needle on the speedometer over the mechanical stop and allow it to fully release and come to a stop. Mark the full stop position on the gauge face using a pencil or other marking tool which is easily removed when the speedometer is reassembled. If your speedometer does not have a mechanical stop, proceed to the next step. 12. Gently pry up on the speedometer needle to remove it from its shaft. 13. Remove the two screws that hold the face plate on the speedometer. 14. Under the face plate you'll find four screws which you'll need to remove to separate the two halves of the speedometer. Page 4 of 5 15. Once the speedometer halves are separated, you'll have access to the gears for the odometer. You'll have to remove most of the gears to get down to the one which needs to be replaced. 16. The first gear to be removed is the furthest away from the gear to be replaced. It is held in place by a pin which can be pushed out with a small jeweler's screwdriver or small paper clip. 17. The remaining gears are held in place by small e-clips which are easily removed (of course getting them back on is always a little more difficult). 18. When you get the bad gear replaced, assembly is just the reverse of disassembly.

Page 2 of 7 NOTE There are actually two different styles of seal arrangement. In some cases you find three separate seals. However, you may also find a single gasket that has all three seals build in as an integral part of the gasket. The arrows in the picture above show the location of the three seals. The arrangement with three separate seals is the old style arrangement and has been replaced by a single integral seal. 14. Remove all of the old seals from the cooler housing, block, and cooler element. 15. On normally aspirated cars, replace the two o-ring seals on both nozzles for the cooler (999 707 043 40).

Lay a straight edge across the top of the cooler housing next to the cooler element guide boss and determine the distance between the lip of the boss on the cooler element (see picture below) and the straight edge. The distance should be 0 +/0.25 mm. Do NOT install the cooler housing gasket before taking the measurement. Install shims (944 107 219 00) as necessary to obtain the required measurement. Shim thickness is 0.5 mm. Normally no more than one shim is required. 18. On normally aspirated cars, replace the cooler element rubber mount (944 107 153 02) in the groove on the block. Apply a coat of light grease to the ring to hold it in place on the block during assembly. Page 5 of 7 19. On normally aspirated and turbocharged cars, install a new gasket (944 107 147 03) on the block. Some gasket sets are still showing up with three separate seals instead of one integral gasket. In either case, use a coat of light grease to hold the gasket/seals in place while mounting the cooler assembly. 20.

On the surface, replacing the oil pan gasket seems like such a simple job. However, it requires dropping the front suspension cross-member which requires the engine to be supported from above. In addition, on turbocharged cars, the cross-over pipe must be removed which requires removing the intake manifold. When you replace the oil pan gasket, it's also a great time to replace the rod bearings. You can figure on about 8-10 hours to replace the gasket on a normally-aspirated 944 and 12-14 hours for a turbocharged car. Porsche recommends in a Technical Bulletin (# 9005), that Silastic RTV 730 sealant be applied to the inside and outside corners of the oil pan gasket. Silastic 730 is good for high temperature applications and does not beak down in an oil environment. However, it is also brutally expensive. A tube typically runs over $100 USD. So, I typically use some other type of sealant in place of the Silastic 730. I normally use Permatex Ultra Grey sealant which is an oil and fuel resistant sealant. A Porsche mechanic friend of mine has never applied any type of sealant to the pan gasket and has never had one come back early with an oil pan gasket leak. The point here is, use the correct sealant or don't use anything at all.

Place the vehicle on jack stands. Drain the oil from the pan. On turbocharged cars perform the following: a. Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. b. Using FUEL-09, remove the intake manifold. c. Using the applicable section of EXH-01, remove the turbo cross-over pipe. 5. Remove the front stabilizer bar assembly-to-chassis (drop link) bolts and control arm bolts and remove the stabilizer from the vehicle. 6. Disconnect the steering tie rod ends. Personally, I prefer a &quot;gear puller&quot; type separator as opposed to the &quot;fork/splitter type&quot; separator. It is much easier to disconnect the tie rod ends without damaging the boots using the gear puller type separator. 7. Place alignment marks on the splined input shaft on the steering rack and the universal joint on the steering shaft so they can be assembled in the same orientation on installation. ( A punch and hammer or brightly colored finger nail polish will work fine.) 1. 2. 3. 4. Page 2 of 5 8. Disconnect the steering gear shaft using a punch and hammer. Be careful not to damage the splines on the steering shaft. 9. Remove the bolts that attach the suspension control arms to the chassis. 10. Disconnect the ball joints that hold the steering knuckles to the control arms. 11. Remove the bolts in the top of the motor mounts that hold the motor mount to the motor mount bracket. 12. If you have power steering, disconnect the lines for the power steering rack at the power steering pump. Have a catch pan and catch rags ready to collect any power steering fluid that drains from the pump and lines. I also recommend wearing gloves when disconnecting the lines. Power steering fluid tends to irritate the skin of some folks. 13. Support the cross member using a floor jack and a piece of wood. 14. Support the engine from above using the appropriate tool (described in tool section). 15. Remove the four cross-member to body bolts. Leave the steering rack and stabilizer bar attached to the cross-member and lower the entire assembly (including the control arms) from the vehicle. This should clear enough stuff out of the way to remove the oil pan. 16. Remove the 22 oil pan retaining bolts (10 mm). 17. Remove the oil pan from the vehicle. This may require a small pry tool to loosen the oil pan from the bottom of the crankcase. 18. If you are going to replace the rod bearings now is a good time to do that. As a minimum, you should inspect the inside of the crankcase from underneath the vehicle for obvious signs of damage. Check the oil pickup tube to make sure it is completely intact (no cracks in the tubes), that it is firmly mounted, and clean any debris from the screen at the bottom of the tube. 19. Clean and inspect the oil pan. Remove any debris from the pan and determine if the debris in the pan indicates damage to the engine / bearings (i.e. metal filings, etc.). 20. Remove the old oil pan gasket from the pan and install the new gasket onto the pan. Apply appropriate sealant to the corner areas of the oil pan gasket (refer to the discussion on sealants found in the Introduction section). I found it much easier to install the pan when I applied a small amount of adhesive in various locations around the outside edge of the gasket to hold it in place while installing the pan. I used 3M Trim Adhesive. However, DO NOT USE too much adhesive and only apply it to the very outside edge of the gasket or it will interfere with the gaskets sealing ability. NOTE In order to ensure a proper seal on the oil pan gasket, it is imperative that the torque specs and torquing sequence for the oil pan bolts be strictly adhered to. DO NOT overtorque the oil pan bolts. Page 3 of 5 21. Install the pan onto the crankcase using the mounting bolts but, do no fully tighten the bolts. Once all the bolts are installed tighten them using the torque specs and sequence shown below: o Step 1 - Install bolts o Step 2 - 4 Nm (3 ft-lbs) o Step 3 - 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) 22. Install the steering rack and cross-member assembly. As you raise the crossmember into position under the oil pan, ensure the motor mounts align with the motor mount brackets and install the motor mount bolts (M8). Also, align the steering linkage with the splines on the steering rack (using the alignment marks made during the removal) as the cross-member is being raised into position. When the cross-member is fully raised into position, install the four cross-member bolts (M12) and torque (19 mm socket) to 85 Nm (63 ft-lbs). Torque the motor mount bolts (13 mm socket) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). 23. Install and tighten the bolt that holds the steering linkage to steering rack splined shaft. 24. Reattach the hoses from the power steering rack to the power steering pump. 25. Install the control arm-to-chassis bolts (M10) and torque to 46 Nm (34 ft-lbs). 26. Attach the control arm ball joints (M10) to the steering knuckles and torque the lock nuts to 50 Nm (37 ft-lbs) . 27. Install the front stabilizer bar. Torque the stabilizer linkage-to-body bolts (M8) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). If you have steel control arms, torque the stabilizer-to-control arm locknuts (M8) to 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). If you have aluminum control arms torque the stabilizer-to-control arm locknuts to 25 Nm (18 ft-lbs). Page 4 of 5 28. On turbocharged cars perform the following: . Using the applicable section of EXH-01, install the turbo cross-over pipe. a. Using FUEL-09, install the intake manifold. b. Using FUEL-02, install the fuel rail and injectors. 29. Install the oil drain plug and fill with engine to the appropriate oil level. 30. Connect the battery positive lead. 31. Remove the vehicle from jack stands.

Therefore, don't be surprised if oil pressure continues to decline after the coolant temperature has stabilized at its normal operating temperature. Occasionally, you may see your oil pressure drop to less than 2 bar. This may happen on very hot days when the car has been driven particularly hard. You should be extremely concerned if the oil pressure dropped to less than 1 bar. This is indicative of an problem with the oil pressure indication or the oiling system itself. Under these circumstances, the car should not be driven until the cause of the low oil pressure indication is determined and corrected. There are several things that may indicate a problem with the oil pressure indication. If your oil pressure is pegged high (5 bar) or won't indicate less than 4 bar at normal operating temperature, there is likely a problem with the oil pressure sending unit. Problems with the gauge itself and problems which cause the oil pressure indication to fail low are very rare. A low oil pressure normally indicates an actual problem with the oiling system. One of the problems which may cause low oil pressure is a failed oil pressure relief valve. Although I've never tried it myself, I've read reports from others who have removed the relief valve and turned the engine over to verify that oil comes out the hole for the relief. If oil comes out of the relief hole, this indicates a problem with the relief. If no oil or very little oil comes out, this normally indicates a problem with the pump itself. If a problem with the pump is indicated, check for proper tension on the crankshaft pulley bolt. The crankshaft bolt applies force to a spacer which in turn tensions a gear that drives the oil pump. If the crankshaft bolt is loose the gear will not turn the oil pump. Low or no oil pressure can also be caused by a broken oil pump pickup tube. This is normally caused by excessive vibration when the motor mounts are bad. The oil pan must be removed to replace the tube. If there is no oil pressure indicated when the car is started, the oil pump may have lost its prime. If this is the case, try removing the oil filter, pour oil down the center hole while rotating the crankshaft in the counter-clockwise direction to prime the oil pump. Then install a new oil filter. Then start the car to see if you have oil pressure. Oil pressure which tracks normally but is lower than normal throughout the indicating range can indicate a leaking oil pressure relief valve or worn main and/or rod bearings.

Early 1987 924S used the spring and piston relief valve as well. Early 1987 engines which began production in July 1986 received a new one piece pressure relief valve. A one piece pressure relief valve was also produced as retrofit for the early three piece relieve valves. The part number for the retrofit relieve valve is 944 107 035 11. The part number for the early 1987 relief valve was 944 107 035 01. However, the early relief valves were not corrosion treated and were subject to failure. All 1987 engines produced from October 1986 on received a corrosion treatment which alleviated most of the failure problems. The table below lists 1987 engines by number and which relief valve they received. The early 1987 relief valves should be replaced during oil cooler seal repairs or at the first sign of oil pressure related problems. This valve was later replaced by a newer style one piece relief valve (944 107 035 02).

If you have a vehicle that uses an old style three piece relief valve, I recommend NOT replacing the old style valve unless it fails. In my opinion, the old style valve is just as reliable as the new style valve. The newer style valve is also a bit pricey. When replacing the relief valve it is important to ensure that you get the correct one piece relief valve for your particular vehicle. The two relief valves are of different lengths and are not interchangeable. The table below lists vehicles and part numbers for each relief valve.

One of the things that I don't particularly like about the new style relief valve is that oil cooler housing alignment is critical to prevent binding of the relief valve. To accomplish this an alignment tool should be used when the oil cooler housing is being installed. Cars which have relief valve 944 107 035 02 use special tool 9262/1. Cars which use relief valve 944 107 035 11 use special alignment tool 9215.

Disconnect the battery negative lead. 2. Place the car on jack stands. 3. From underneath the car, remove all skid/belly pans which protects the bottom of the engine. NOTE On normally aspirated cars the power steering pump may not have to be removed to access the oil pressure sending unit. On turbocharged cars and normally aspirated 944s that have added external oil coolers, the addition of oil lines for the external oil cooler provides additional obstruction that requires the power steering pump be moved out of the way to access the oil pressure sending unit. 4. Disconnect the power steering pump (leaving all lines attached) and hang it out of the way. Remove the belt tension adjusting turnbuckle without changing the adjustment and you will be able to reinstall the pump without having to adjust the belt. 5. Disconnect the two wire leads to the oil pressure sending unit (located just below the oil filter). NOTE When you replace the unit, you should use a new crush washer on the sender. The Porsche PET nor the 944 Parts and Technical Reference Catalog show a crush washer on the sending unit. However, on every car I've ever replaced the sending unit, there was a crush washer. So, go to your local auto parts store and get an M18 x 24 (the important part is the M18) aluminum or copper crush washer. 6. Using a 15/16&quot; or 24mm stubby open end wrench, loosen the oil pressure sending unit. Have some catch rags in place to catch any oil that drips out. Also, have the new sending unit ready to install to minimize the amount of oil that drips out. 7. Remove the old sending unit and immediately insert the new one. Torque the sending unit to 35 Nm (25 ft-lbs). This will require a 24 mm (15/16&quot;) open ended crow's foot for your torque wrench. If you don't have one and don't want to go buy one, just make sure the sending unit is snug but, don't force it or you'll damage the seal ring. As long as you use a new seal ring, it shouldn't leak. 8. Reconnect the wires to the terminals of the new sending unit. Page 1 of 2 NOTE The sending unit has two terminals. Normally one is a straight post and the other is a post with a spaded connector on it. Sometimes the new sending units will come with spaded connections on both posts. Use the flat side of old sending unit as a reference to determine which post should have the spaded connector. If you get the terminals reversed, the gauge will be pegged high and the low oil pressure light will flicker on at idle. 9. Once the wires are connected, reconnect the battery positive lead and start the car to verify proper operation of the oil pressure gauge. 10. Reinstall belly pans and low car from jack stands.

There is a possibility that you may have an early oil pump on one of the later cars. I have a 1986 944 Turbo which had an original engine whose block was manufactured in 1985 and had an early oil pump. Procedure Place car on jack stands or ramps. Disconnect battery positive lead. Using ENG-13, set engine at TDC on cylinder number 1. Using ENG-03, remove the starter and install the flywheel lock (P9206). Using ENG-05, remove the balance shaft belt, timing belt, rollers, balance shaft sprockets, crankshaft gear, and rear timing cover. 6. Remove the crankshaft gear Woodruff key from the crankshaft. 7. If the oil pan is to be removed, refer to the applicable steps of LUBE-06 and remove the oil pan from the vehicle. Otherwise loosen/remove the oil pan retaining bolts as necessary to lower the front of the oil pan slightly. 8. Remove the oil pump retaining bolts and slide the oil pump off the end of the crankshaft. Page 2 of 4 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 9. Remove the oil pump drive gear from the pump. Inspect the drive gear closely. It will over time develop a ridge which will prevent proper sealing with the crankshaft oil seal. If a ridge is evident on the drive gear, it should be replaced. 10. Remove the main oil pump seal from the oil pump housing. 11. If the oil pump is to be disassembled for inspection prior to reusing, apply Loctite 574 to the outer edge of the pump insert during assembly. 12. Install a new main seal in the oil pump housing and install the oil pump drive gear. Page 3 of 4 13. Apply Loctite 574 to the sealing surfaces of the oil pump prior to installation on the block. 14. Install the oil pump onto the block by sliding on to the end of the crankshaft and install the pump mounting bolts. Torque the M6 pump mounting bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) and the M10 bolt to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). 15. Install the crankshaft gear Woodruff key into the recess on the crankshaft. 16. Using ENG-06 install the timing belt, balance shaft belt and all rollers. The belts are tensioned during the performance of ENG-06 using ENG-10. 17. Install the air filter assembly (AF-01). 18. Reconnect battery. 19. Install skid pan. 20. Remove car from jack stands/ramps.

The DME then adjusts the amount of fuel to correct the mixture. The O2 sensor is also known as a Lambda sensor. When the DME is operating based on the feedback signal from the O2 sensor, this is referred to as Closed Loop operation. If the O2 sensor is faulty or is disconnected, the DME computer operates in Open Loop mode. In this case, the DME simply proves the fuel by determining the amount of air flow into the engine and selecting the appropriate amount of fuel from a set of preset fuel maps. On 944s which do not have O2 sensors (many ROW cars), the DME operates in Open Loop mode from preset fuel maps. For O2 sensors to operate correctly, they must be heated up to normal exhaust system temperature. There were two types of O2 sensors used on 944s. Early 944s used a singlewire O2 sensor which is simply heated by the engines exhaust up to normal operating temperature. The single wire provides output signal to the DME. Since it takes some time for the O2 sensor to get heated up, the DME operates in Open Loop until it reaches normal temperature. Later 944s use a three-wire O2 sensor (called a heated sensor) where there is one signal wire and two wire to provide power to the sensor to heat it up more rapidly. This reduces the amount of time that the DME operates in Open Loop before the sensor provides a good output signal. Generally, heated O2 sensors last about 60,000 miles and non-heated (single wire) sensors last about 30,000 miles. Porsche recommends replacing the O2 sensor every 60,000 miles but, does not differentiate between heated and non-heated sensors. Symptoms of a Bad O2 Sensor The following are some of the symptoms you might see if your O2 sensor is failing or has already failed: · · · · · Engine surges or hesitates Strong smell of gas from the exhaust Poor fuel economy Failed emissions due to high CO or high HC levels Catalytic converter (if equipped) becomes prematurely clogged Page 1 of 5 Testing the O2 Sensor 1. 2. 3. 4. Start the car and run until engine is at normal operating temperature. Disconnect the O2 sensor and connect a voltmeter to the sensor plug. Run the engine at approximately 2500 rpm. Introduce propane into the intake to enrich the mixture until the engine rpm drops by 200 rpm. You may be able to create the same affect by disconnecting the vacuum line to the fuel pressure regulator. However, you'll have to plug the vacuum line to prevent a vacuum leak to the intake manifold. If the voltmeter reading rapidly rises to greater than 0.9 VDC the O2 is correctly indicating a rich mixture. If the voltmeter response is sluggish or the voltage remains below 0.8 VDC, the sensor should be replaced. Secure the propane addition. While continuing to run the engine at 2500 rpm, disconnect a vacuum line from the intake to cause a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication rapidly drops to less than 0.2 VDC, the O2 sensor is properly reading a lean mixture. If the voltmeter indication responds sluggishly or remains above 0.2 VDC, replace the sensor. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Or if you've order a sensor kit which comes with connectors, you'll have to install the connectors which come with the kit onto the new sensor wires. DO NOT solder the connectors onto the wires. They must be crimped on for the O2 sensor to work correctly. For the sensor to work correctly, it must draw clean air down to the sensor through the air gaps in the stranded wire. If you solder the wires, the solder will fill the air gaps in the wire and the sensor will not work correctly. Do not use any silicon based chemicals that could become exposed to the O2 sensor. Silicon will contaminate the sensor and it will quit working. Many RTV sealants, gasoline additives, and anti-seize compounds contain silicon so, check the label before you use it. Page 4 of 5 Replacement 1. First locate and disconnect the O2 connector plug. It will be a round connector plug at the back of the engine (unless it's been previously replaced with a universal sensor with plug kit). If necessary locate the sensor first and trace the wire up to the connector plug. 2. After you've unplugged the sensor, locate the sensor and remove it using the appropriate size open ended wrench (or O2 sensor socket if you happen to have one). 3. If you are installing a universal sensor, prepare the new sensor for installation by splicing the plug from the old factory sensor onto the new sensor wires. If it's a universal sensor kit which comes with connectors, install the new connectors on to the sensor wires and onto the factory wiring harness. 4. Install the new sensor and tighten. 5.

It's more intended to inform 944 owners as to what exactly it takes to PROPERLY paint a 944. I've seen many unhappy 944 owners due to botched paint jobs performed by otherwise very competent body shops. The problem that occurs is that shops that don't have a lot of experience with 944s simply don't understand everything involved in painting a 944 and therefore grossly underestimate the cost of the job. Hopefully this article will provide you with enough information to ensure that the shop you're using understands how to paint a 944 or that you can provide instructions to your body shop as to how your car should be painted. Preparation Just like painting any other vehicle, ninety percent of ensuring a quality paint job on a 944 is in the preparation. However, to properly paint a 944, the preparation can get pretty involved. There are a lot of body parts on a 944 which must be removed and painted while of the car for professional results. Therefore, the painting process can become pretty labor intensive. Expect a quality paint job to run anywhere from $2500 - 4000 depending on location. Every shop approaches painting a 944 differently. What I'm going to describe is how my car was painted. Quite honestly, I don't know how the shop could have been more thorough. Let's start with the front of the vehicle. The headlight covers should be removed as well as the nose panel. That is of course assuming the nose panel is removable. I realize that on 924s and early 944s the panel isn't removable and must be painted on the car. Also remove all the ground effects in the front of the car and paint them off of the car. On normally aspirated 944s, that means removing the front spoiler and front bumper. Remove the lights and bumper pads from the front bumper. On cars with the turbo front end, remove the fog lights and remove the front bumper cover. On all cars, remove the side mark lights. Moving on back on the car, remove the mirrors and door handles. Also remove the trim pieces on the roof. Remove the sunroof and all of the seals in the sunroof area. Paint the sunroof off of the car. At the rear of the vehicle, remove the hatch from the car. Remove the tail lights, license plate assembly, bumper cover, ground effects, and side markers. Page 1 of 2 After all of the necessary parts have been removed the car and all removed parts should be sanded, all dents and dings repaired, and primed. To ensure a perfect painting surface, the car should be &quot;blocked&quot; after priming. You're body shop will know what that means. Basically, it's a process where a second coat of primer is applied of a different color. The body is then hand sanded. As the top color is sanded off, the base color with show through unevenly if the surface isn't level. These areas can then be leveled before painting. This concludes the preparation. I know it may seem a bit overwhelming. However, the outcome of the job is all in the preparation. Once the painted surfaces are properly prepared, the painting is relatively simple. © Page 2 of 2");sQ1[327]=new Array("pdf-manual/info-01.pdf","Performance Products and Services Vendors","","Performance Products Vendors Vendor Area951 Under Pressure Performance Contact Info Owner - Scott Gomes 3 Whaler's Way Fairhaven, MA 02719 508-989-3970 Email - underpressure@attbi.com Web Site - http://www.area951.com Products and Services Electromotive Engine Management Systems, Full Race Preparation, Engine Building, Head Porting and Machining, Custom Roll Bars and Cages Owner - Chris White 944 Enhancement 2373 Route 174 Marietta, NY 13110 Phone - 315-636-8716 Electromotive Engine Management Systems, Leda Coil Over Shocks and Struts, Brake Email - enhancement944@earthlink.net Components, Clutch Web Site http://home.earthlink.net/~enhancement944/index.html Packages, Racer's Edge Suspension Components Page 1 of 3 Performance Products Vendors Vendor Speedforce Racing Contact Info Owner - Tim Richards 208 Greenfield Drive Suite L.

As always, procedures submitted by other owners are always welcome. Thanks Erik. Foreword by Author I just recently did this work. In my case, the two hoses that connect to the reservoir were old and leaking, as well as the power steering pump. From what I've learned talking to the experts at the shop, it's a fairly common problem with 944s. Are you sure that the reservoir is the part that's leaking? It would seem to me that the hoses have more of a history of leaking rather than the reservoir, as it's a single, solid, plastic part, and not prone to leaking. A DIY mechanic should be able to do the work with little problem (depending on how small and nimble yours hands are), provided that you have the needed tools and needed spare parts. You'll have to make sure that you get the right hoses, as these part numbers are for a my 944, and not a turbo. Here is a picture from the PET CD: Page 1 of 3 Getting short hose in place (#26) is really easy. The harder one is the longer one (#39) is harder. The hardest part is to get the clamp on way up the fender well back on. I managed with a slight tap with a hammer on the mounting clip. Another thing to note is that it's easier to have everything connected loosely so that you can wiggle on all the connections that you need to make before tightening everything down and restricting movement. Page 2 of 3 Procedure 1. Remove lower plastic splash guards (have to do this any time that you want access to the bottom 1/2 of the engine). 2. Remove the right front plastic inner fender cover, so you'll have better access. 3. Remove clamp on hose #26 down by the pump. Be ready to catch the ATF that will be coming out. 4. Loosen the two pump pivot bolts that attach the pump to the engine. 5. Loosen the pump side of the belt tensioning bracket, and then remove the pump belt from the pump. 6. Once the ATF has drained out, loosen the two reservoir clamps and remove the two hoses. Remove the reservoir from the car for a throughout clearing with mineral spirits, and lastly, soap water and a through hot water rinse. Set aside and let dry completely before re-installation. 7. Loosen and remove the pump bolts and the pump by letting it swing down. 8. Remove all the parts on the old pump that you will need to put on your new pump. 9. Fish out hose #39, as well as hose #26 being sure to remove all the mounting clamps that you can find. 10. Replace house #39 first, as it's harder, and then hose #26, make sure to have the hose clamps and mounting clamps back on where you'll need them. 11. Mount all the parts on the new pump. 12. Bolt #8 is a strange one. You need to make sure that it's very tight otherwise, the power steering fluid will leak out. 13. Remount the pump. 14. Connect the hoses to the pump. 15. Connect the pump belt and tensioner. You should still be able to have a 1/4&quot; deflection on the belt, so it's not too tight. 16. Tighten all the hose connections and the hose mounting clamps, including the ones to the reservoir. 17. Tighten the reservoir mounting down. 18. Fill with ATF Dexron as specified by the owner's manual. 19. Idle engine and watch the fluid level drop, add fluid as needed. 20. While idling, turn the steering wheel back and forth to work out any air in the system. 21. Add fluid as needed. 22. Inspect for leaks, and re-tighten hose clamps as needed. 23. Once all the leaks are gone, lower the car so that there is some weight on the front wheels. Turn the steering wheel back and forth again while weight is on the front tires to stress the power steering a little bit. 24. Raise the car, and inspect for leaks, and re-tighten hose clamps as needed. 25. Remount the plastic fender inner liner as well as the plastic splash guards again.

I'd like to thank Doc for taking the time to write this procedure and take pictures to go along with it. Foreword by Author The following details how I resealed my power steering rack. A seal kit can be gotten from Travis at www.rennbay.com for about 70 bucks. A rebuilt rack can be acquired for 225-250 with core exchange, so if you want to try and reseal yourself and save some money, you can find instructions here, on Rennbay's site, and also on www.arnnworx.com. Doc Wilen Tools · · · · · · Good selection of metric sockets and a few long extensions for removing and replacing the wiper seals. A small pick (dental pick is ideal) Hammer, punch Reseal Kit Needle nose pliers Allen key for removing the hard lines (6mm) Other Procedures Needed · STEER-01, Power Steering Rack Replacement Procedure 1. Using STEER-01, remove the steering rack from the vehicle. 2. Have a large CLEAN workspace with a lot of clean rags or a roll of paper towels or both. Lay out the seal kit on a strip of paper towels, so you can easily match up the seals as you remove them from the rack. I found it easiest to remove one seal at a time, match it up, put the new one on the rack, and move on to the next one. When you remove an old seal and match it up, place it off to the side somewhere where it will not get mixed up with the new seals. On some o-rings it is hard to tell the old ones from the new ones if you are not careful. Page 1 of 8 3. With the rack on the workbench, remove the hard lines using an Allen wrench. (I had to use a vise-grip on 1 bolt due to it being stripped. These can be on pretty tight. They need to come off, because there are 2 rubber o-rings per fitting that need to be replaced, for a total of 8 rubber o-rings. 4. Using a punch and a hammer, removing the locking collar that holds the 2 halves of the rack together. It will just screw off. In the picture below, you can see the collar has been removed and slid back on the bronze tube. The bronze tube (steering sleeve) will then separate from the gray control tower. Note the hard lines had not been removed yet when this picture was taken. 5. Remove rubber boot from the top of the control tower that surrounds the spindle, then remove the three 10mm bolts. You can then carefully pry the top off of the control tower. The top will have 1 wiper seal in it, and an o-ring as seen below. Note the orientation of the wiper seal before you remove it. The groove side will be on the inside of the tower, with the flat side pointing outward. Page 2 of 8 6. Grab the steering gear where the steering shaft normally attaches, and turn the gear counter clockwise while pulling up on the gear, the main unit will slide out of the control tower, also allowing the steering rod to be pulled from the control tower as well. The following picture will show all the pieces apart. The yellow arrow is the shuttle The red arrow is the steering rod The purple arrow is the steering gear The blue arrow is the control tower The gray arrow that is hard to see is the steering sleeve These are probably not the official names. 7. The steering gear. Once removed from the control tower, make sure you keep the spacers and bearings lined up in the proper orientation. One the gear itself are 4 hard plastic rings (white). Underneath each is a standard rubber black o-ring. Remove these with a pick and replace them with the new seals. The left picture shows before, and the right picture shows them replaced. The new hard plastic rings are blue. Page 3 of 8 8. The control tower: After you remove the steering gear, there is a wiper seal at the bottom that needs to be removed. This is a real pain in the butt to remove, because you can't get a socket behind it to hit it out. Destruction may be the only way to get it out, just make sure not to nick the edges of the control tower. Again the groove faces upwards as you are looking at the seal from the top. This is the HARDEST seal to get out of the rack. And it is a very important seal, as it keeps fluid from leaking out of the rack on the driver's side. Chances are you will nick the metal casing when trying to remove the seal, and if you do so, the rack will most likely leak when you get it back in the car. Then you get to drop the 250 for a rebuilt rack. 9. On the passenger side of the control tower, there is a large o ring in a groove that needs to be replaced. The smaller one you see actually came off the end of the shuttle, and belongs next to the white spacer that sits on the outside of the shuttle. Page 4 of 8 10. The steering shaft and shuttle. There is a shuttle that slides back and forth on the steering shaft itself. Inside the shuttle is a wiper seal and hard white rubber spacer. To remove the shuttle from the steering shaft, you must remove 2 snap rings, a couple of washers, and another seal mechanism. Again there is a hard white rubber ring on the outside of the seal mechanism, and a rubber o-ring underneath that. Also when you slide the washers off the shaft, there will be another 2 rubber o-rings underneath. Once all those are removed, the shuttle can be removed. You could also force the shuttle off over the teeth on the steering shaft, but you would not want to put on the shuttle in that direction due to possibly hurting the new wiper seal. In the picture below, the right picture shows the seal mechanism and the shuttle in place on the shaft. The shuttle is pushed all the way against the seal mechanism. In the left picture, half the seal mechanism is removed (there is still 1 washer and 1 snap ring on the shaft), and it shows the 2 o-rings underneath it. Again that blue plastic seal replaces the white seal that was originally on the unit. 11. The shuttle. Remove the shuttle from the steering shaft. Inside is a wiper seal and a hard plastic spacer underneath it. Using the appropriate sized socket, pound the seal out of the shuttle, and install the new spacer and seal. Again the groove in the wiper seal will face out, or toward the passenger side of the vehicle. Page 5 of 8 12. On the outside of the shuttle is a hard plastic ring, and a rubber o-ring that holds the ring onto the shaft. In the following picture, the plastic ring is on, but the oring is currently removed (it is actually seen in a previous picture if you read the description.) The o-ring will go on the outer side of the plastic ring (in the picture, to the right). 13. The bronze steering sleeve. Inside is a wiper seal, a plastic spacer, and a plastic guide ring. The plastic guide ring is removed first, using a small pick and needle nose pliers. When I removed it, I thought I was going to break it, but it seemed to flex pretty easily and come out. Page 6 of 8 14. Next, take the appropriate size socket and knock out the wiper seal and spacer. Note, the tube size steps down as it gets closer to the seal, so if you put the tightest fitting socket in the end of the sleeve and try to pound out the seal, you will be hitting on the sleeve itself, and the seal won't move. I had use a socket that was a little smaller. The seal came out in about 3 hits. Again the groove on the wiper seal will face towards the control tower, or drivers side of the vehicle. This is looking in from the long end of the tube. The seal will be hit from the opposite end, and come out towards you (as if you are looking at this current picture). You can see the groove in the seal. The white rubber spacer is behind the wiper seal. Page 7 of 8 15. The above picture is misleading (not how it will come out of the sleeve), as the wiper seal is turned the wrong way, it should be flipped so that you are look at the back of the seal (flat side). 16. That is about it for seals that need to be replaced, install everything in the opposite direction. Make sure you use the correct size socket to install the seals (and make sure they go in the right way, if they are installed the opposite direction, they will leak). Make sure you pound the seals in evenly. The seals went in pretty easily for me. Total time to replace the actual seals is probably an hour or 2 if you take your time. The pictures are kind of hard to understand if you haven't had your rack apart yet, but once you get it apart, everything is pretty simple. There really is no way to mix up the seals, as the sizes are all pretty different. The write up is not perfect yet, but should be able to help anyone currently trying this procedure.

Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes 1. Park your vehicle in a suitable work space with a minimum of 1 meter clearance around the car. 2. Apply the parking brake, open the driver's side window, block the rear wheels and disconnect the negative lead of the battery. Page 2 of 9 3. Use your choice of 19mm wheel wrench and loosen the front wheel lug nuts just enough to allow easy removal after the tires are off the floor. 4. Jack each side of the car sequentially at the designated jacking points and place jack stands under the frame rails in the vicinity of the jacking points. NOTE Obtain as much ground clearance as possible staying within the manufacturer's recommendations of your equipment. Approximately 18 inches worked fine for me. 5. Remove the front wheels and set aside. (sounds like we're baking a cake!) 6. Remove the 7 undercover panel (belly pan) bolts using a 3/8 drive ratchet and 10mm socket, and remove the undercover. 7. With the car secure, place the catch basin under the power steering pump. Using a 19mm wrench, remove the pressure line from the pump, and allow the power steering fluid to drain into the basin. 8. Turning the steering wheel lock to lock several times will help void the steering gear of fluid. (aren't you glad you opened the window?) Allow to drain completely. 2.0 - Front Sway Bar Removal Tools Needed: 13mm socket, 13mm wrench, 17mm wrench, 8 inch long 3/8&quot; drive extension, flat blade screwdriver. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes 1. On the passenger side, use a 13mm socket and a 13mm wrench to remove the 2 clamp bolts holding the sway bar to the frame anchor. 2. On the drivers side, use the 13mm socket on the extension to remove the 2 bolts attaching the sway bar frame anchor to the frame. Removal of the frame anchor provides working clearance for Step 3. 3. Use the 17mm wrench to remove the nut attaching the sway bar to the control arm on each side, and remove the sway bar. With a screw driver, loosen the clamps on the alternator cool air intake tube and remove it also. You should now have a clear path to the steering gear shaft and universal joint clamp. Page 3 of 9 3.0 - Disconnect Tie Rod Ends Tools Needed: 19mm wrench, gear puller, (or &quot;pickle fork&quot; ) Estimated Time Required: 20 minutes 1. On each side, use the 19mm wrench to loosen the locking nut on the tie-rod end ball joint. Turn off the nut until it is just slightly above the end of the stud. 2. Use a small gear puller to disconnect the tie-rod end from the steering knuckle. TIP You may be able to get the tie rod ends to pop out by banging on the end of the steering knuckle, eliminating the need for a gear puller or pickle fork tool. This tip is provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. NOTE A pickle fork can be used however this almost always damages the ball joint rubber boot and should be avoided if the tie-rod end is to be reused. NOTE If your vehicle uses self locking nuts to secure the tie rod ends, (they have a rounded top and no washer of any kind or cotter pin is employed) I have been told that these must be replaced. The theory is they stretch after one use and are not reliable for reuse. I had zero success finding these locking nuts at any automotive store and substituted standard nuts with locking washers. Page 4 of 9 4.0 - Disconnect the Steering Column Lower Universal Joint Clamp from the Steering Gear Tools Needed: 13mm wrench, 13mm socket, 12 inch long 3/8 drive extension, short pry bar. Estimated Time Required: 15 minutes 1. Turn the steering wheel until the universal clamp bolt head is in line with your access from under the car. 2. Reach in behind the steering column to put a 13mm wrench on the nut and use the 13mm socket and extension to remove the clamp bolt. The clamp bolt must be completely removed before the universal can be removed from the steering gear. NOTE Some light pressure from a small pry bar ( or large screwdriver) should be sufficient to loosen the clamp from the shaft. The universal and clamp will not come all the way off until the steering gear unit is lowered. 5.0 - Rack Removal Tools Needed: 13mm wrench, 6mm Allen wrench. Estimated Time Required: 15 minutes 1. Use the 6 mm Allen wrench to remove the return line from the steering gear housing of the rack. NOTE I understand some lucky individuals have hex-head hollow bolts. If you have the Allen head like mine and you're unfortunate, the hollow bolt attaching the line will have seized and you will need channel locks to remove it. TIP If you have the Allen head hollow bolts, you may want to consider replacing them with hollow hex head bolts which are available from the dealer. It makes it much easier to attach the return hose after the rack is in place as there is room between the rack and cross-member to tighten the bolt with an open end wrench. This tip provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. 2. Remove the pressure line support clamp from the rack housing and the ground wire that is attached at that location. Page 5 of 9 3. Then, with the 13mm wrench, remove the 4 rack mounting bolts. 4. Slide the rack out of its mounting journals and simultaneously slip off the steering universal joint as you lower the rack assembly. 5. Since your replacement rack is probably bare, you will need to remove the following items from your old rack for installation on the new rack: o High pressure line support clamp and 10mm bolt o Rack line rubber spacer o Plastic compensating line with two plastic L-shaped fittings (they just pull out) o Left and right side mounts 6.0 - Tie-rod Removal from the Rack Tools Needed: 3 inch vise, soft jaws, 30 mm wrench, cold chisel. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes 1. Label the left and right tie-rod ends for re-assembly. 2. Pull the boots away from the steering gear housing to expose the rack and inner ball joints of the tie-rod assembly. If your seals were blown as bad as mine, this is another opportunity to get a Dexron II bath! 3. Extend the driver's side of the rack all the way out. This will expose approximately 75mm (3 inches) of rack teeth which should be clamped tightly into the soft jaws on the vise. I used two pieces of aluminum angle to make soft jaws. If you have a 4 inch vise, you will have to angle the rack in order to get a good grip on the flats of the rack teeth. NOTE Mounting the rack in the vise securely is an important step as it is imperative that no pressure be applied to the steering gear mechanism. 4. At each end of the rack, there is a small locking notch (about 8mm) which should have the flange of the inner ball joint peened into it. Use the cold chisel to carefully remove the peened portion of the flange. 5. Then, using a 30 mm wrench, or large crescent wrench, remove the tie-rod assemblies from the rack. Both ends are right hand thread, just in case you were wondering. You can now mail in the old rack and get your core charge back! Page 6 of 9 7.0 - Tie-rod Installation in the Rack Tools Needed: 3 inch vise, soft jaws, 30 mm wrench, flat nosed chisel (drift). Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes 1. Place the new rack in the vise as described in Step 6 taking care not to remove or contaminate the new gear grease. 2. Screw in the left and right tie-rod assemblies. By making sure the tie-rod assemblies are installed as labeled, your wheel alignment should be satisfactory for a short drive to the alignment shop. 3. For power steering units, apply 52 ft-lbs of torque to each tie-rod assembly using the 30mm wrench. NOTE In lieu of the specialty Porsche torque wrench, a 50 pound pull scale can be used in conjunction with your favorite 30mm wrench. Simply divide the 52 ft-lbs. torque requirement by the distance from the center of the flange nut to the point at which you can anchor the pull scale. This value is the required measure of force which should be applied perpendicular to your wrench via the pull scale. Just pull on the scale until it reads the value you calculated. 4. The odds are in your favor that an intact portion of the inner ball joint flange will be adjacent to the locking notch. Use a flat punch to peen the flange against the corners of the locking notch. Thread lock products are not recommended. 5. Remove the rack from the vise and re-install the boots on the steering gear housing. 8.0 - Rack Installation Preparation Tools Needed: Same as removal. Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes General Note: The manuals I've seen typically say &quot;Installation is done in the reverse order of removal.&quot; This is basically true, however it is simply not that easy in this case. Prior to installation, it is important to get all your original parts back on the new rack. The following assembly order worked for me: (See Photos 1 and 2) 1. Slide right and left side mounts into place. 2. Install rubber spacer under the rack line. 3. Attach high pressure line using new bronze crush washers (torque to 15 ft-lbs) I tightened mine as tight as possible with a 6 inch long 6mm Allen wrench. 4. Loosely attach support clamp with 10mm bolt. (you will have to remove it later) 5. Insert the L-shaped fittings on the ends of the compensating line. Page 7 of 9 6. Snake the compensating line into position and firmly push the fittings into place on the rack housing. 9.0 - Rack Installation Tools Needed: Same as removal plus optional 10x1x35mm bolt and a grinder. Estimated Time Required: 60 minutes 1. First center the rack. This is done by removing the threaded plastic plug from the view port on the underside of the steering gear housing and turning the steering shaft until a red dimple in the rack gear is in alignment with the view port. (see photo No. 3) 2. Once in alignment, thread a 10x1x35+/-mm bolt into the view port to lock the rack in the centered position. The bolt should have a smooth tapered end to engage the dimple. (fire up the grinder!) TIP Instead of fabricating a locking bolt with a tapered end, you may want to try inserting a ball bearing into the view port hole to engage the dimple and threading an unaltered bolt into the hole to lock the ball bearing in place. This tip is provided courtesy of John Smaardyk. 3. With this accomplished, place the rack assembly into position on the passenger side of the car and finger tighten one of the passenger side mounting bolts. Allow the driver's side to hang down slightly. 4. Next, reach in the window of the car and turn the steering wheel until it is straight. You may want to have and assistant hold the steering wheel straight for you. (my daughter did an excellent job!) 5. At this point, the open side of the universal clamp should be in generally good alignment with the flat side of the steering gear shaft. 6. Align the split in the clamp exactly in the center of the shaft flat. If you don't, the clamp bolt cannot be installed. 7. With the steering column universal joint clamp positioned over the steering gear shaft, push the rack assembly up into position. The universal clamp will now slide down the steering gear shaft where it belongs. 8. Install and hand tighten the upper driver's side mounting bolt. If the universal clamp did not side into position completely, use a small hammer and lightly tap it down until none of the flat is visible beneath the clamp. (believe it or not there is room to do this!) 9. Install and tighten the clamp bolt. Install and finger tighten the remaining two mounting bolts. 10. Getting the mounting bolts aligned and finger tightened is a bit of a chore but absolutely necessary to avoid cross threading the aluminum cross member. 11. Tighten the rack mounting bolts to about 23 Nm (17 ft-lbs). Page 8 of 9 12. Install the high pressure line mounting clamp and ground wire. 13. Attach the high pressure line to the power steering pump using new bronze crush washers. (torque to 33 ft-lbs) 14. Attach the return line to the rack housing using new bronze crush washers. (torque to 15 ft-lbs.) 15. Use a plastic tie wrap to bundle the high pressure line and compensating line to the rack. The wrap should be placed at the same location as the rubber rack line spacer. 16. Remove your custom centering bolt (if you used one), then replace and tighten the view port plastic plug. 17. Connect the tie rods to the steering knuckles tightening the locking nuts to about 30 ft-lbs. You will need to apply sufficient pressure to the tie rod end ball joint shaft to prevent it from turning in the knuckle. I used the same small puller I took them apart with and a flat &quot;cushion&quot; plate on the bottom of the tie rod end. 18. Install the fresh air tube and the driver's side sway bar mounting bracket. 19. Next, install the sway bar. This must be done by connecting the ends first. The sway bar to control arm mounting bolts should be tightened to 18 ft-lbs. 20. Then using a jack, raise the sway bar until the mounting clamps are in alignment with mounting brackets. Be sure both sides go into the proper position simultaneously. Install the clamp bolts and tightened to 17 ft-lbs. 10.0 - Bleeding The System Tools Needed: NA Estimated Time Required: 30 minutes 1. Install the wheels and lower the car off the jacks. 2. Fill the power steering reservoir with Dexron II or III automatic transmission fluid. 3. Reconnect the battery and start the car. 4. Wait a few minutes to give the fluid time to find its way. 5. Bleed the air from the new rack lines by slowly turning the steering lock to lock until no more air bubbles appear in the reservoir and the fluid level remains constant. 6. As a final check, compare the fluid level in the reservoir with the engine stopped and with the engine running. If the fluid level rises more than 10mm, there is still air in the system and you should repeat the bleeding process. 7. Once this is complete, you're back on the road and off to the alignment shop. Congratulations you just saved yourself $????? and learned something new as well. Drive safe.

Over time, the hatch seals tend to dry out and shrink. As a result, the hatch does not fit as tightly and it can rattle or squeak. If so, this can often be corrected by adjusting the two posts on the rear hatch. To adjust the posts, loosen the lock nut next to the hatch. To tighten the post, turn it clockwise several turns and then tighten down the lock nut. Be careful not to tighten the post to much or the hatch will difficult to latch and unlatch. Another possible cause is latch mechanism for the rear hatch. The latch mechanism needs to periodically lubricated. Use a good quality grease to lubricate the latch mechanisms on both sides. A combination of lubrication and adjusting the posts will often solve a squeaky hatch. Finally, the most difficult hatch repair is caused by the rear glass separating from the hatch frame. This is caused by repeatedly slamming the rear hatch. The vibration caused by slamming the hatch closed, over time, causes the glass to separate from the frame. That's why it's important to close the hatch by lowering it down against the hatch opening gently and then pushing down on the rear of the hatch to latch it. There are several schools of thought with regard to repairing the rear hatch. Many will tell you that the car must be taken to a professional glass service to be re-glued. While this does ensure a quality repair, it can also be very costly. There are others who have taken on this repair themselves and have successfully repaired the rear hatch. However, the hatch has to be removed from the car for repair. So, if you decide to do the repair yourself, you should have someone assist you during the removal and installation. Page 1 of 3 Repairing Separated Glass Introduction There are a number of different sealants/adhesives that can be used to repair the rear hatch glass. The best ones are urethane based. Probably the best overall is 3M Window Weld Urethane Auto Glass Sealant. Procedure 1. Remove the rear hatch as follows: a. Disconnect the rear window defroster wires (one on each side). b. Disconnect the rear hatch shocks. c. Lower the rear hatch but do not allow it to latch. You may place a piece of wood between the back of the hatch and the body to prevent the hatch from latching. d. From inside the car, remove the bolts that hold the rear hatch hinges to the body of the car (2 hinges - 2 bolts per hinge). On early cars, there's a cover over the hinges. On later cars, the rear header panel will have to be removed. e. Have someone assist you to lift the rear hatch off of the car. 2. Remove the trim strips from around the edge of the hatch. You'll find clips that hold the strips in place. In most cases, the clips are accessed from the underside of the hatch. 3. Work slowly and carefully to pry the frame off of the hatch glass. Scrapers usually work well for separating the glass from the frame. 4. Using an adhesive remover and scraper, remove the remains of the old sealant. 5. Reinstall the hatch frame onto the car with it in the closed position. Do not attach the hatch shocks yet. 6. Make sure the hatch frame fits properly to the hatch seals. Over time the hatch frame may have become bent and may need to be bent to get a proper seal. 7. Place a bead of sealant all the way around the hatch frame following the directions for the adhesive. 8. Place the glass on to the frame and push down around the edges to make sure the glass makes good contact with the frame. Here's a good suggestion from Vaughn Scott for installing the glass. &quot;With the glass upside down, maneuver it so that it's behind the car with the rear edge facing forward. Place the rear edge of the glass in the rear of the frame and rotate it forward until the front of the glass is about a foot from being in place. Have one person hold it in place while the other person goes inside the car and takes the weight of the glass. Then the person outside of the car pulls their hands out of the way and the glass is lowered into place.&quot; Page 2 of 3 9. Using the adhesive, fill in any gaps between the glass and the frame. 10. Allow the adhesive to cure for at least 24 hours. 11. Reinstall the trim strips and clips. This may require unbolting the hatch hinges. 12. Attach the shocks to the hatch.

The early style gauge was used on all models of 924s and on 944s up to the 1985 model year. The later gauge was installed on 1985.5 and newer 944s and 968s. One of the difficult things about using a 924/944/968 coolant temperature gauge is that there are no real temperatures indicated on the gauge face. This can make it difficult to determine if the gauge, cooling system, or cooling fans are operating properly. It is therefore help to know what temperatures correspond to the markings on the gauge face. The diagrams below show those relationships. Temperatures are shown in degrees Celsius. Many times I hear folks ask &quot;what the normal coolant temperature for a 944?&quot; Well, it's a difficult question to answer because there are a number of factors which can effect coolant temperature. However, generally speaking, in cool to moderate climates (up to about 25 °C) driving on the highway, 944 coolant temperatures will normally run between 80-90 °C. Under these conditions, the system typically runs cool enough that the radiator cooling fans will not run. In warmer climates (25-35 °C) and in heavy traffic conditions with stop and go driving, coolant temperatures may run as high as 100 °C. The cooling fan(s) should come on at approximately 92 °C to reduce coolant temperature. If your coolant temperature consistently runs higher than 100 °C, it's time to start looking for problems. Realize that the problem could be an actual high temperature problem or it could be a problem with the temperature sensor or gauge. Time and time again, I hear folks complaining about the car's coolant temperature running significantly higher than normal. When I start talking to them, I frequently find that these symptoms occur after a round of performance modifications where they've increased the horsepower the engine is making. What is frequently overlooked is that when an engine makes more horsepower, it makes more heat and more heat is rejected to Page 1 of 9 the cooling system. Since nothing has been done to increase the capacity of the cooling system, with the increase heat load the steady-state cooling temperatures are naturally going to run higher than before. This means that the cooling fans will run more frequently, run longer, and have a harder time reducing/maintaining coolant temperature in hot weather and in stop and go driving. Realize also that this also means higher steadystate oil temperatures, lower oil viscosity, and hence lower than normal steady-state oil pressures. Coolant Temperature Gauges Early 944 (Pre-1985.5), 924 Late 944 (1985.5 and Newer) The numbers in red on the early gauge were determined by FR Wilk through interpolating the Bosch sender curves. Testing Coolant Temperature Gauges Tools · · · Multimeter Variable Resistance Potentiometer (Minimum 0-500 ohms) Test Leads Page 2 of 9 Procedure 1. Disconnect the two spade connector leads from the temperature gauge sensor. 2. Using the appropriate table below, set the variable potentiometer to one of the resistances listed. Early 944s (pre-1985.5), 924 Temperature (°C) 40 105 120 Resistance (Ohms) 287.4 33.6 22.7 Page 3 of 9 Late 944s (1985.5 and Newer) Temperature (°C) 40 60 80 100 115 Resistance (Ohms) 287.4 134.0 69.1 38.5 25.8 4. Connect the larger of the disconnected sensor leads to one terminal of the variable potentiometer being careful not to change the potentiometer setting. Connect the other terminal of the variable potentiometer to a grounding point in the engine compartment. 5. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. 6. Check the temperature gauge reading compared to the required indication for the resistance on the variable potentiometer. 7. Repeat as necessary for all temperature-resistance combinations in the table. 8. If the gauge appears to be reading normally and you still suspect that the temperature readings are abnormal during engine operation, proceed to the temperature sensor testing procedure. 9. If you determine that the gauge is bad, replace it or send it to an authorized VDO repair facility for service. Page 4 of 9 Testing Oil Pressure Gauge Problems with the oil pressure indication are commonly caused by a failing oil pressure sending unit. Normally, at startup when the ignition switch is turned on, the oil pressure will indicate 5 bar. Upon starting the engine the oil pressure should indicate between 4.5 5 bar. As the engine heats up the oil pressure will gradually decrease until the oil reaches normal operating temperature. At that point the oil pressure will normally indicate around 2.5 - 3 bar. On very hot days the oil pressure could indicate as low as 2 bar. If the indication falls below 2 bar and remains consistently below 2 bar, it could indicate a problem with the main or rod bearings. Oil Pressure Gauge Testing · · · Multimeter Variable Resistance Potentiometer (Minimum 0-500 ohms) Test Leads 1. Disconnect the leads from the oil pressure sending unit. Page 5 of 9 2. Using the multimeter and the variable potentiometer, set the potentiometer to one of the resistances listed in the appropriate table below for your vehicle. 1982-85 944 Oil Pressure (Bar) 0 3 5 Resistance (Ohms) 10.0 116.0 184.0 1985.5 and Newer 944 Oil Pressure (Bar) 1 2 3 4 5 Resistance (Ohms) 29.6 65.3 98.9 133.6 184.0 4. Connect the oil pressure sending unit lead which was removed from terminal &quot;G&quot; on sensor to one leg of the variable potentiometer. Connect the other leg of the variable potentiometer to a grounding point in the engine compartment. Page 6 of 9 5. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. 6. Check the oil pressure gauge reading compared to the required indication for the resistance on the variable potentiometer. 7. Repeat as necessary for all oil pressure-resistance combinations in the table. 8. If the gauge appears to be reading normally during testing and abnormally during engine operation, there may be a problem with the oil pressure sending unit. If you don't have the resources to fabricate connections to apply an external pressure source to the sending unit, it may be necessary to simply replace the sending unit without testing.

When you stop pushing, if the car rebounds more than twice, the rear shocks need replacing. Some folks will tell you to test one side at a time because they may replace only one shock if it's bad.

This procedure will describe how to test the sensors for proper operation. It will also describe how to replace and adjust the sensor clearance if they are bad. The sensors are located on the top of the clutch housing at the back of the engine. You can locate them by looking from the driver's side of the car (left-hand drive) down at the back of the engine near the firewall. Here's a picture showing what the sensors look like: Tools · · · · · 10 mm socket or 5 mm Allen head socket (depending on type of sensor retaining bolt) 6 mm Allen head socket 0.8 mm thick washer Multi-Meter (for checking sensor resistances) Oscilloscope (optional - for checking sensor output) Page 1 of 6 Checking Sensor Operation Sensor Resistance Checks 1. Disconnect the Sensor plug connector at the back of the engine compartment. 2. Using a multi-meter, check the sensor resistances as follows: Speed Sensor Terminals 8 - 27 8 - 23 Terminals 25 - 26 25 - 78 Resistance Reading 600 - 1600 ohms &gt; 1 M-ohm Resistance Reading 600 - 1600 ohms &gt; 1 M-ohm Reference Sensor Page 2 of 6 Sensor Operational Checks An operational check of the speed and reference sensor output signals is the ultimate test to show whether the sensors are providing proper signals to the DME computer. However, to correctly perform the test, it requires an oscilloscope. We'll also discuss checking the output with a multimeter. 1. Remove the fuel pump fuse. 2. Disconnect the DME computer plug. 3. To check the speed sensor output, connect an oscilloscope from terminals 8 - 27 on the DME plug. 4. Crank the vehicle and check for a saw tooth wave output with a peak-to-peak voltage of &gt; 2.5V. 5. To check the reference sensor output, connect an oscilloscope from terminals 25 26 on the DME plug. 6. Crank the vehicle and check for a periodic pulse with a peak-to-peak voltage of &gt; 2.0V. The frequency of the pulses depends on the starter cranking speed. 7. If either voltage is less than the spec, check the sensor clearance using the section titled &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot;. NOTE The sensor output signals can also be checked using a multi-meter. However, checking with a multi-meter will only tell you if there is and output signal and will not correctly measure the magnitude of the output voltage. So, it will not tell you if the signal is of significant magnitude to be sensed by the DME computer. Another way to check the operation of the speed and reference sensors it to crank the vehicle and watch the response of the tachometer. If the tachometer jumps during cranking, the speed and reference sensors are probably good. If it does not jump, it indicates a problem with the speed and/or reference sensor or the DME computer. If it's the speed and/or reference sensors, it could be a bad sensor or the clearance gap is too large (see &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot;). Page 3 of 6 Sensor Removal 1. Disconnect the battery negative lead. 2. Disconnect the speed and/or reference sensor connectors at the back of the intake manifold. 3. Remove the sensor retaining bolt. Two different types of retaining bolts were used on the sensors. You'll need a 5 mm Allen head socket or 10 mm socket and ratchet to remove the sensor retaining bolts. 4. Twist the sensor from side-to-side as you pull up on it. Sometimes they'll get stuck and twisting will help free them. Sensor Installation 1. If both sensors are to be replaced, check the labels on the wiring harness near the connector bracket and at the sensor mounting bracket to ensure correct installation. On the wiring harness the label will read as follows: o DG = Speed Sensor o BG = Reference Sensor The mounting bracket is labelled as follows: o o D = Speed Sensor B = Reference Sensor It is sometimes difficult to read the marks on the mounting bracket. If you can not read the marks, the sensor closest to the firewall is the speed sensor. Page 4 of 6 NOTE I ran across a situation once while installing and engine in a 944 where the wire labels were missing from the wire connectors going to the DME Plug connector and the connectors had been removed from their mounting bracket. So, it was impossible to tell which wiring harness connector went to which sensor. To identify the connectors, I had to take resistance readings using an ohmmeter from the DME Plug connector to the sensor connectors. If you run into the same situation, you can use the diagrams below and an ohmmeter to determine which connector goes to which sensor. 2. If the sensor mounting bracket was moved or you are unsure if the sensors are correctly aligned perform the &quot;Adjusting Sensor Clearance&quot; procedure below. 3. Install the sensors and retaining bolts. Torque retaining bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb). Adjusting Sensor Clearance 1. The speed and reference sensors do not normally need adjustment even after replacement. Adjustment is only required if the sensor mounting bracket is removed or the mounting bracket locking bolt is inadvertently loosened. 2. Remove the speed sensor. 3. Loosen the mounting bracket locking bolt (6 mm Allen head) and pivot bolt and then re-tighten finger tight. Page 5 of 6 4. Glue the 0.8 mm thick washer to the bottom of the sensor. NOTE I have an clearance adjustment sensor. This is an old speed sensor with the electrical lead cut off to which I have washer permanently glued. 5. Install the sensor with mounted washer and tighten. 6. Move the bracket down until it stops again the ring gear on the flywheel. 7. Tighten the mounting bracket locking bolt and pivot bolt. 8. Remove the sensor with washer. 9. If the sensor is to be reused, pry the washer off the sensor. 10. Install sensor and torque retaining bolt to 8 Nm (6 ft-lb). 11. Reconnect battery.

It can also be used to determine how different wheel and tire size combinations will affect your speedometer. If you are trying to verify the accuracy of your speedometer, you should be confident that your tachometer is indicating correctly. If you doubt the accuracy of your tachometer, obtain a strobotach / stroboscope and check it or have a speedometer shop check it for you. You will also need to determine your gear sizes, final drive ratio, tire size, and wheel diameter to plug into the program. If you have an owner's manual, the gear sizes and final drive ratio will be listed there. For the tire and wheel size, simply look on the side of tires on your drive wheels (i.e. for a rear wheel drive car, look at the rear tires).

Any standard DIN head unit will fit. However, there are some minor issues which must be considered. When you remove the factory head unit, you will likely have to install a mounting frame for the new head unit. If you have purchased a new head unit the mounting frame will be included. However, if you are buying a used head unit, make sure the seller includes the mounting frame as well (if required). If you are installing sub-woofers, or plan to install subwoofers in the future, make sure the new head unit has &quot;sub-woofer out&quot; or &quot;rear speaker out&quot; connections. Normally, units with &quot;sub-woofer out&quot; connections will also have a sub-woofer volume adjust as well. However, you may want to ask that question when purchasing the unit. Sub-woofer volume adjust on the head unit is a very nice feature because it allows you adjust everything at the head unit when balancing the sound. If you don't have sub-woofer controls, you end up having to tweak the gain on the sub-woofer amp to balance the sound. This is definitely a plus if the sub amp must be placed in a location that is difficult to access. All 944s which employ windshield antennas also use an antenna amplifier. The antenna amplifier is powered from a lead which goes from the head unit to a wire that ties in with the antenna lead. The problem is that there are actually two leads which come from the head unit (both red with white stripes) which feed into the wiring harness and come back out of the harness to a single black lead. The single black lead ties in with the antenna lead. Consequently, when you install the new head unit, you'll need to run a power lead off the head unit to the black amplifier lead or to the two red wires with white stripes going to the black amplifier lead. Newer 944s (1985.5 and newer) with 4-speaker systems use a front-to-rear fader control for the speakers (mounted on the center console). So, there are left and right channel feeds going from the head unit to the fader. Coming out of the fader are leads for each of the 4 speakers. If your head unit has a two-channel output, you'll connect to the to leads going to the fader just like the factory unit. If you have a head unit with a four-channel output, I prefer to bypass the fader and connect to the speaker leads coming out of the fader. This allows you full use of the fader controls on the head unit. If you bypass the factory fader switch, you may abandon it in place or you may remove the fader and obtain a blank switch cover to go in it's place. Page 1 of 3 Speakers Our discussion here will focus on 944s with 4-speaker systems. I haven't talked to a lot of folks who have done replacements on the 10-speaker system so, there just isn't a lot of information available at this point. There are two distinct challenges when replacing the speakers in a 4-speaker 944 system fitment of the front speakers and access to the rear speakers. For the front speakers, there are a number of issues with regards to finding a speaker that fits. Both front and rear speakers are 4x6 Euro cut speakers. A 4x6 American cut speaker can be used as well. However, for the front speakers, the mounting plate for the American cut speaker must be trimmed or the bottom of the door panel must be loosened to allow the edges of the mounting plate to slide under the panel. Personally, I have the 4x6 American cut speakers and didn't find it too inconvenient to loosen the bottom of the door panel for the installation. Also, you must use a speaker with a thin mounting plate. A speaker with a thick mounting plate will prevent the factory grill from sitting flush with the door panel. The next fitment issue for the front speakers is depth. The door window channel runs directly behind the door speaker. The factory speakers use a 1/4&quot; spacer. If you reuse the speakers, you can get about 1-3/4&quot; clearance. Even that limits your choices with regards to speakers. If you go with a deeper speaker, you will have to use a thicker spacer is which case the factory speaker grills will not sit flush anymore. Aftermarket grills are available but, they are hard to come by. American International (AI) is one of the few places I've found that offers 4x6 grills. If you have a decent car audio shop in your area, they should be able to locate aftermarket grills for you. Also, you can't use a grill that protrudes from the surface of the door panel more than 1/2&quot; or it will contact the side of the dash with the door closed. If you want to use the factory grills (as I did), you also have to make sure that the replacement speakers do not have any parts/components that are raised above the surface of the speaker more than about 1/4&quot;. Otherwise, the grills will not sit flush with the door panel. The last issue with front speaker fitment is the size of the speaker frame. For virtually all the aftermarket speakers I tried (and I trial fitted a lot of speakers), the oval part of the speaker frame was slightly larger than the oval cutout in the door panel. This will prevent the speaker from sitting flush against the door panel. Consequently, the factory grill will not sit flush either. I eventually had to go with the speaker that was the best fit and enlarge the opening in the door panel slightly to allow a perfect fit. I did this by taking a small hammer and tapping on the sides of the opening to flatten the lip on the opening slightly. When you are trying to decide on a front speaker, I recommend removing one of the door speakers and then drive to a local stereo/sound and ask them to allow you to trial fit different 4x6 speakers until you find one that fits properly. I have read reports from other 944 owners of speakers which fit well without any modifications. Below is a list of 4x6 speakers used by other 944 owners, with comments on fitment and sound quality. The list was provided to Rennlist by Menelaos Karamichalis. Thanks Menelaos.

Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft. 5. Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column. Page 1 of 3 b. For cars with air bags: 1. The air bag can be removed after the battery has been disconnected for at least 30 minutes. 2. On the back side of the steering wheel there are two Torx head screws which are recessed into the back of the column. Using a T30 Torx socket and ratchet, remove the screws. 3. Slide the air bag assembly off of the front of the steering column and disconnect the plug on the back of the air bag. Set the air bag aside where it can not get damaged (face up). 4. Using a 15/16&quot; (or 24 mm) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and the washer behind the nut. 5. Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft. 6. Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column. Page 2 of 3 Installation 1. Slide the steering wheel on to the steering column paying attention to the alignment marks made during removal. 2. Install the wheel retaining nut and torque to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs). 3. For non-airbag cars attach the horn button wire to the horn button pad and press the pad into place on the steering wheel. 4. For airbag equipped cars, attach the wire to the back of the airbag, slide it into the steering wheel, and attach by installing the two Torx head screws (T30). 5. Standing outside the car reach into the car and turn the ignition on. The reason for being outside the car is that this is one of the times I've seen airbags inadvertently deploy. Start the car and see if the airbag warning light is illuminated. If it is, reset the warning light using ELECT-12.

You can also purchase 3M Urethane Stone guard material and make your own stone guards using your old stone guards as a pattern. The 3M Stone guard material is also known as Scotchcal. The only problem is that you may have trouble finding someone to sell you the stone guard material in small quantities. You'll need material that is available in at least 12 inch widths. 3M advertises rolls of 12 mil urethane on their web site but, it comes in 20 yard rolls. The 12 mil may be a bit heavy. The part number is PN84712. They also advertise a 6 mil urethane which comes in 40 yard rolls. The 3M part number is PN84812. Personally, I'd shop around for smaller quantities. While I haven't been able to locate them yet, I understand that there are several places that offer sheets of 8 mil urethane in quantities to do two complete sets of stone guards.

Using the heat gun, heat one edge of the stone guard until it can be lifted using the plastic putty knife. Keep the heat gun moving back and forth and do not apply excessive heat as it will soften and potentially damage the paint. 2. Once you get one edge lifted, grasp the edge of the stone guard and pull gently as you apply heat just ahead of the edge that's lifted. Again, keep the heat gun moving, do not heat excessively, and do not apply too much pressure or you will lift the paint along with the stone guard. 3. If you get to a spot that's stubborn and does not want to lift, apply some of the adhesive remover behind the lifted edge. Continue to apply heat but, do so carefully as most adhesive removers are flammable. 4. Once the stone guard is completely removed, clean the area with adhesive solvent to remove any remaining adhesive. Installation NOTE New stone guard material should only be applied to paint that is completely dry and properly cured. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Mix a solution of isopropyl alcohol and water (about 15% alcohol) Thoroughly clean the area where the stone guard will be applied. Apply the alcohol solution to the area.

Disconnect the battery negative cable. 2. Loosen the four strut mounting bolts in the engine compartment several turns. Do not remove yet. 3. Place the vehicle on jack stands. 4. Remove the front wheels. 5. Remove the brake line from the clip on the front strut. 6. At the bottom of the strut, there are two bolts which attach the front strut to the spindle assembly. The top bolt is an eccentric bolt which provides for adjustment of the wheel camber. Using a paint pen, scribe, or brightly colored nail polish, mark the orientation of the eccentric bolt to the strut. 7. Remove the eccentric bolt and bottom retaining bolt from the bottom of the strut. 8. Pull the strut away from the spindle until it is free from the bottom of the assembly. 9. Hold the strut while removing the four mounting bolts at the top of the strut. Remove strut from the vehicle. 10. If the strut is to be replaced, note the orientation of the eccentric bolt alignment mark from Step six and transfer that mark to the new strut. Strut Insert Replacement CAUTION! Extreme caution must be used when using double spring compressors where the springs are not held rigidly in place. This is the type of compressors you'll normally find for sale in auto parts stores or those offered by auto parts stores for loan. I've seen a number of folks get badly hurt when the spring popped out of one of the compressors. The key to using this style or spring compressor safely is to make small adjusts and alternate sides after each adjustment. The safest type of compressor is a rigid wall or stand mounted professional spring compressor. However, most of us aren't willing to go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a professional spring compressor. So, you have two options. You can use the double spring compressors as described above or you can simply take the strut assembly and the new insert to a suspension and brake shop and have them swap the insert for you. 1. Using a spring compressor tool, compress the coil over spring to until there is only a slight amount of pressure on the strut assembly top plate. NOTE If you attempt to use a regular socket and ratchet to remove the strut assembly top plate retaining nut, the strut rod will simply spin as you turn the retaining nut. An air impact wrench is needed to spin the nut fast enough to break the nut free without spinning the strut rod. Page 2 of 4 2. Using an air impact wrench and socket, remove the spring strut bearing retaining nut. 3. Remove the bearing from the strut. 4. Slide the strut assembly out of the spring 5. If you're rebuilding the old strut perform the following: a. Clamp the assembly in a vise and remove the strut assembly insert cap using Porsche tool 9186 or a similar tool. b. Remove the old insert from the strut. c. Remove any oil from the housing and clean the inside of the housing. d. Install the new cartridge. Ensure that the spacer is installed between the cap and the cartridge. e. Torque cartridge cap to 150 ± 30 Nm (111 ± 22 ft-lbs.). Note From Factory Shop Manual The shock absorber housing may be filled with thin oil or ATF to improve cooling. However, the shock absorber housing should not be more than max. 2/3 full, if cartridge is touching bottom of housing. If too much oil was added, it would run out of the housing when hot. This would automatically cause incorrect diagnosis (defective absorber). 6. Install the spring onto the new or rebuild strut assembly. 7. Install the bearing onto the spring strut assembly. 8. Using an air impact wrench and socket, tighten the spring strut bearing retaining nut. Torque the retaining nut to 77 Nm (57 ft-lbs.). 9. The strut assembly is now ready to be installed in the car. Installation 1. Insert the new or rebuilt strut assembly up through the opening at the top of the strut tower and loosely install the four retaining nuts on top of the strut tower. 2. Slide the bottom of the strut onto the spindle and install the bottom retaining nut and top eccentric nut. 3. Set the top eccentric nut to the orientation mark on the strut made during the strut removal. 4. Tighten the eccentric bolt locking nut and the bottom retaining bolt lock nut. NOTE Even though the strut was aligned using the mark for the eccentric bolt, the car should be taken to an alignment shop to have the camber checked at the first opportunity. Page 3 of 4 5. Tighten the four retaining bolts on top of the strut tower. 6. Attach the brake line to the clip on the strut. 7. Install the front wheels and lower the vehicle.

On cars made after February 1986, the lifting arms are operated by plastic gears (one for each lifting arm mechanism). The plastic gears have a small set of teeth which operate the lifting arms. They also have a large set of teeth which are driven by a flexible cable. The cable is driven by the sunroof motor. For cars produced before February 1986, there is a gear box between the two lifting arm mechanisms. This gear box has a single gear which moves the lifting arms via two short lengths of drive cable. The guide tubes for the short sections of the flexible drive cable are routed such that the drive cables are directly engaged in the teeth on the lifting arms as opposed to using a plastic drive gear in each lifting arm housing. The sunroof drive motor assembly is located in the rear hatch area behind the vertical section of carpet on the driver's side of the car. On most cars the motor assembly will have a plastic cover over it which is held in place by six Phillips head screws. The sunroof system on all 944s uses a series of micro-switches to stop the lifting arms in different positions. The functioning of the sunroof depends on the ignition switch position and the direction that the console switch is operated. The ignition switch on 1985.5 and newer cars is a three-position switch whereas the early ignition switch is a two-position switch (OFF-ON). On the later cars, it's a OFF (0) - ACCESSORY (1) - ON (2) switch. You'll frequently hear the ignition switch &quot;ON&quot; position referred to as ignition switch position 2. To operate the sunroof in the open or closed direction, the ignition switch is turned to the &quot;ON&quot; position. To release the sunroof the ignition switch must be in the &quot;OFF&quot; position for the early 944s or in the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position for the late Page 1 of 15 model 944s. Specifics on how to operate and remove the sunroof are discussed in another section of this procedure. All sunroofs installed since February 1986 have three limit switches which are operated by a plastic cam attached to the sunroof drive cable. The cam assembly rotates as the drive motor moves the drive cable and as the cam rotates it operates the limit switches. In cam position 1, the lifting arms are fully retracted back against the body of the sunroof so that the sunroof can be removed from the car. This is referred to as the &quot;released&quot; position. In this particular instance, both Limit Switches I and II are made. Limit Switches I and II are ganged together and can only be adjusted together. Limit Switch I is the bottom switch and Limit Switch II is the top switch. They function to stop the lifting arms in the &quot;locked&quot; position. If the lifting arms are in the released position and both limit switches are not made or are not functioning properly, the lifting arms can not be moved to the &quot;locked&quot; position. In cam position 2, the lifting arms are partially raised so that the sunroof is still closed but, it is locked in the closed position. As the lifting arms are moved toward the locked position, the cam rotates. When the cam reaches position 2, Limit Switch II drops out to stop the sunroof motor. As previously mentioned, the ignition switch must be in the ACCESSORY position to operate the sunroof between the retracted and locked positions (from cam position 1 to 2). When moving the lifting arm from the locked position to the released position, movement of the lifting arms is stopped by the slip clutch on the sunroof motor when the lifting arm tabs contact the body of the sunroof opening. This is a very common problem area. Over time, the motor slip clutch torque tends to increase. There really isn't a good explanation for why this occurs but, it does. Eventually, the torque will get high enough so that when the lifting arms are retracted and come in contact with the body, the sunroof motor have enough torque to cause the drive cable to strip the teeth on the plastic sunroof gears. The procedure for adjusting the slip clutch torque will be discussed later. To raise the sunroof from the locked position, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed (Up Arrow), the sunroof will start to raise and the cam rotates. As soon as the cam starts to rotate, Limit Switch I drops out. The sunroof will continue to raise as long as the console switch is depressed until the roof Page 2 of 15 reaches the fully open position (cam position 3). When the cam hits limit switch III, the sunroof stops in the fully open position. To lower the sunroof from the fully raised position, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed (Down Arrow), the sunroof lowers until cam position 2 is reached. When the cam makes Limit Switch I, the sunroof stops in the locked postion. The operation of sunroofs on 944s produced from 1982 to February 1986 is essentially identical to that of later 944 sunroof systems. The primary differences are in the physical construction of the sunroof equipment. One of the major differences is the set up of the drive motor and limit switches. The early sunroof assembly does not use a rotating cam to operate the limit switches. Instead, there is a guide rail attached to the sunroof motor which extends toward the rear of the car. At the very back of the guide rail is two limit switches. These are equivalent to Limit Switches I and II on the late model sunroof systems. They function together to stop the lifting arms in the locked position and are operated by a plastic dog that is attached to the end of the drive cable. Like the late model sunroof, in the locked position, one limit switch is made and one is not. To open the sunroof, the ignition switch must be in the ON position. When the console switch is depressed the sunroof moves in the open direction and is stopped when the mirco-switch mounted between the sunvisors drops out. The micro-switch is operated by a tab attached to the front edge of the sunroof hatch. As the back of the sunroof hatch raises during opening, the tab on the front of the hatch swings down. When it swings down far enough, the mirco-switch drops out (electrically opens) and the sunroof motor stops. This micro-switch is also used on the late model sunroofs but, merely functions as a backup to Limit Switch III. From the locked position, to move the lifting arms to the released position (for sunroof removal), the ignition switch must be in the OFF position. As the lifting arms move to the released position, movement of the lifting arms is stopped by the motor's slip clutch when the lifting arm tabs contact the body of the sunroof opening. Page 3 of 15 And, when moving the lifting arms from the released position to the locked position, the sunroof motor is stopped when one of the limit switches drops out. The mircro-switch between the sunvisors also performs an additional function on both early and late model sunroofs. It tells the system that the sunroof is installed. If the sunroof is installed but, the lifting arms are released, the system will automatically move the lifting arms to the locked position when the car starts moving. If the sunroof fails electrically, it can be operated manually. However, operating an early sunroof manually is difficult at best and should only be done if absolutely necessary. Directions for sunroof manual operation are contained in another section of this procedure. To troubleshoot problems with the sunroof system, refer to the troubleshooting section of this procedrue. Normal Operation On pre-1985.5 cars, the sunroof is operated by turning the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position. The sunroof console switch is then pushed back (&quot;A&quot; direction) to open the sunroof and pushed forward (&quot;B&quot; direction) to close. NOTE The ignition switch on 1985.5 and newer cars is a three-position switch whereas the early ignition switch is a two-position switch (OFF-ON). On the later cars, it's a OFF (0) Accessory (1) - ON (2) switch. You'll frequently hear the ignition switch &quot;ON&quot; position referred to as ignition switch position 2. To operate the late model sunroof, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position. The sunroof console switch is then pushed back (up arrow) to open the sunroof and pushed forward (down arrow) to close. Page 4 of 15 Removing the Sunroof 1. Retract the sunroof lifting arms as follows: a. On pre-1985.5 cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Depress the sunroof switch in the back direction (&quot;A&quot; in picture from previous section) to retract the sunroof lifting arms. b. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position (1). Depress the sunroof switch in the back direction (Up Arrow on Switch) to retract the sunroof lifting arms. 2. Release the two latches at the front of the sunroof. 3. From inside the car, push up on the back of the sunroof and slide it off of the wind deflector and front guides. Page 5 of 15 Installing the Sunroof 1. Slide the sunroof hatch on to the wind deflector guides until it seats at the front of the sunroof opening. 2. Lower the back of the sunroof in to the sunroof opening. It should sit flush with the top of the roof. 3. Engage the latches at the front of the sunroof. NOTE When raising the sunroof lifting arms from the retracted position (for removal), the lifting arms should automatically stop at the locked closed position. 4. Engage the sunroof lifting arms as follows: a. On pre-1985.5 cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;OFF&quot; position. Depress the sunroof switch in the forward direction (&quot;B&quot; in picture from previous section) to raise the sunroof lifting arms. Page 6 of 15 b. On 1985.5 and newer cars, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ACCESSORY&quot; position (1). Depress the sunroof switch in the foward direction (Down Arrow on Switch) to raise the sunroof lifting arms. Sunroof Manual Operation 1. Operate the early 944 (1982 - February 1986) sunroof manually as follows: a. Unclip the carpet on the driver's side (left-hand drive) of the hatch area. There you will find the sunroof motor and cable drive assembly. b. Below and to the left of the sunroof motor you should find a manual operating tool attached to the cable guide by two wing nuts. Unscrew the wing nuts and remove the tool. c. Below and to the right of the sunroof motor there is an adjusting screw for the motor slip clutch. There should be a cap over the adjusting screw. Remove the cap and, using the tool, remove the adjusting screw (a). d. Once the adjusting screw is removed, you'll find a threaded sleeve inside the opening for the screw. Insert the tapered end of the tool into the sleeve and turn the sleeve to operate the sunroof. Turning the sleeve counterclockwise will close the sunroof and turning it clockwise will open the sunroof. Page 7 of 15 e. When manual operation is complete, install the adjusting screw into the threaded sleeve. Adjust the slip clutch torque using the slip clutch adjustment procedure. 2. Operate the late 944 (February 1986 - On) sunroof manually as follows: . Unclip the carpet on the driver's side (left-hand drive) of the hatch area. There you will find the sunroof motor and cable drive assembly. The assembly may have a plastic cover. Although on many of the late model cars, I've found that the cover has been removed. a. Remove the slip clutch adjusting screw cap. You'll find the cap, below and to the right of the sunroof motor. If the sunroof motor assemby has the plastic cover discussed in the previous step, the adjusting screw cover will be visible in an opening in the motor assembly cover. Page 8 of 15 b. Behind the adjusting screw cap, you'll find a small lock nut which locks the slip clutch adjusting screw in position. Behind that, there is a larger nut which is used to manually operate the sunroof. Use a spark plug socket (13/16&quot;) or a 21 mm socket on the large nut to operate the sunroof. Turn the nut clockwise to close the sunroof and counterclockwise to open. NOTE Since the position of the slip clutch adjustment screw has not been altered, it is not necessary to perform a slip clutch adjustment. Sunroof Motor Slip Clutch Adjustment There are two different procedures for adjusting the slip clutch on a 944 sunroof motor based on whether you have an early style sunroof (before February 1986) or a late style sunroof. The early style sunroof slip clutch is set from the factory and should only be Page 9 of 15 adjusted if the slip clutch adjusting screw has been removed for manual operation of the sunroof. On the style sunroof, the slip clutch adjusting screw is permanently attached and is not removed for manual operation of the sunroof. However, the slip clutch torque should be periodically checked and adjusted if needed. High slip clutch torque is the most common cause of the failure (stripping) of the plastic sunroof gears in the late style sunroofs. If you are unsure whether you have an early or late style sunroof, refer to the pictures below. Note that the motor case on the early style sunroof system is black and the motor is oriented parallel to the ground. The late style sunroof motor case is gold in color, is oriented at an angle to the ground, and has it's electrical connector on top of the motor. Early Sunroof Motor and Slip Clutch Adjusting Screw Location Late Sunroof Motor and Limit Switches Early Style Slip Clutch Checking and Adjustment Page 10 of 15 The early style sunroof motor slip clutch has an adjusting screw that has a locknut that is cemented to the adjusting screw at a preset distance from the head of the adjusting screw (2.5 mm) to ensure proper slip clutch torque. However, if the adjusting screw is removed for manual sunroof operation, the slip clutch torque must be verified by checking the sunroof motor current after the adjusting screw is reinstalled. 1. Remove fuse 9 from the Auxiliary Fuse Panel and connect an ammeter across the fuse block terminals. 2. Thread the adjusting screw into the slip clutch until the lock nut comes in contact with the mounting surface and tighten it slightly. Page 11 of 15 3. Turn the ignition switch on (or insert the key into the ignition) and operate the sunroof switch until the sunroof reaches it's final drive position (full open or fully retracted). I prefer to operate the motor to the full open position as the motor current tends to be higher (due to the weight of the sunroof). Check the motor current when the drive motor reaches it's final drive position. On the early sunroofs the limit switch between the sunvisors mays stop the motor before it reaches the full open position. If so, you may press the micro-switch manually to operate the motor long enough to check the motor current. 4. Tighten the adjusting screw until the motor current is 12 -14 Amps. This may require loosening the adjusting screw lock nut. 5. When the adjusting screw it properly set, tighten the lock nut against the mounting surface and apply heavy strength Loctite to the adjusting screw threads at the lock nut. 6. Disconnect the ammeter and reinstall the sunroof motor fuse (25 A). Late Style Sunroof Slip Clutch Checking and Adjustment 1. Open the sunroof about 1/2 open. This will prevent damaging the plastic gears during slip clutch testing. 2. Using a 21 mm socket and torque wrench, turn hexagonal nut A on the motor slip clutch (see picture below). The clutch should slip at 6 Nm (± 0.5 Nm). I normally like to see the torque at the low end of the spec or even slightly below (5 - 5.5 Nm) to ensure that the plastic gears don't get stripped again. 3. The breaking loose torque of the motor can vary at different gear position. So, the torque should be checked six times at 60 degree angles of rotation on the hexagonal nut A (i.e. 360 degrees total or six times during one full rotation of the nut). Page 12 of 15 A - Checking Torque B - Adjusting Torque C - Lock Nut 4. If the slip clutch needs adjustment perform the following a. Loosen lock nut C. b. Adjust the motor torque by moving adjusting nut B. Loosening nut B will lower the torque. Tightening nut B will raise the torque. c. When the torque is properly adjusted, apply a small amount of Loctite 270 to the adjusting screw threads and tighten lock nut C to a torque of 15 ± 2 Nm.

This micro-switch serves to stop the sunroof in the fully raised position on early 944 sunroof systems (1982 - February 1986). The mirco-switch is also present on later sunroof systems and functions as a backup to Limit Switch III. This micro-switch is one of the more common failure items on the sunroof. It will prevent the sunroof from operating electrically in the open direction. This means that it can prevent the sunroof from moving from the locked position to the open position OR from the released position to the locked position. However, it should NOT prevent the roof from operating in the closed direction. Removing and Replacing the Micro-Switch 1. Release and remove the sunroof hatch. If the sunroof system can not be operated electrically, then manually release the lifting arms using the manual operating instructions in the &quot;Sunroof Operation, Troubleshooting, and Repair&quot; procedure. 2. Carefully remove the triangular shaped flap from the sunroof mount. Use a small flat tip screwdriver or plastic spatula to pry up gently on either side of the flap. The is snapped into clips on the sunroof mount. The clips on the mount or the tabs on the flap can be easily broken if you pry too hard on the flap. Page 1 of 16 3. Once the flap is removed, use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the retaining screw from the mount and press the mount off of the wind deflector bar. 4. If the micro-switch is to be replaced, unsolder the wires from switch and install a new switch. Page 2 of 16 Checking the Sunroof Micro-Switch for Proper Operation For the sunroof to operate in the open direction, the micro-switch between the sun visors must be closed and must remain closed. If the micro-switch is open, fails electrically (open), or has a broken wire in the circuit, the sunroof will not open. 1. Check the operation of the micro-switch as follows: a. Remove the sunroof hatch. b. Press on the flap covering the sunroof mount (covering the micro-switch). c. An audible click should be heard when the flap is depressed. If the click is not heard, remove the flap carefully as described in the previous section. d. Depress the micro-switch operating lever and again listen for an audible click. e. If an audible click can not be heard or if you still have doubts about whether the microswitch is functioning properly, check the switch electrically. Page 3 of 16 2. To check the micro-switch electrically, perform the following: a. Lower the sunroof mount (containing the micro-switch) from the roof panel using the directions for removal/replacement in the previous section. b. Connect an ohmmeter across the two terminal of the micro-switch. It should read infinite ohms ( or OL or Off Scale High depending on what type of meter you use) c. Depress the operating lever for the micro-switch. It should read minimum resistance (&lt; 1 ohm). d. If the switch does not pass the electrical test, replace it. NOTE The sunroof micro-switch is operated by a tab on the front of the sunroof hatch. Sometimes that tab can become bent and will not be high enough to depress the micro-switch operator enough to close the switch. If the micro-switch appears to be functioning normally, check it again with the roof installed and closed. If you press upward on the tab at the front of the sunroof and you hear and audible click from the micro-switch, the tab is not bent enough to keep the micro-switch closed. Remove the roof and bent the tab upward slightly until it will close the microswitch with the roof installed and closed. Main Sunroof Relay Testing 1. On early 944s with the small console switch (see picture below), remove the switch from the top of the console using a small flat tip screwdriver or plastic spatula. Page 4 of 16 2. On late model 944s with the larger switch, disconnect the sunroof switch plug as follows: a. Remove the storage pocket underneath the radio. This can be done by sliding both hands into the pocket, and pressing outward on the sides of the pocket with your hands while pulling the pocket straight out of the console. This will expose two Phillips head screws which you'll need to remove. b. Remove the ash tray from the center console by pulling it straight up out of the console and remove the two Phillips head screws at the back of the console. c. Lift up on the console insert. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. d. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switch which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you more angry than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily. Page 5 of 16 NOTE On early cars the main sunroof relay checks can be performed on in the back of the switch with it connected to the harness. On the later cars, the checks are performed on the disconnected plug for the sunroof switch. 3. Check the main sunroof relay output voltages as follows: a. On early 944 sunroofs, insert the key into the ignition but, do not turn the switch on. On late 944 sunroofs, turn the ignition to the ACCESSORY position. b. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 2 of the sunroof switch / plug. c. On early and late 944s, turn the ignition switch to the ON position. d. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 1 of the sunroof switch / plug. Also, check that the voltage at terminal 2 of the switch / plug is no longer present. Page 6 of 16 4. If the correct output voltages are not present, remove the sunroof main relay. On early 944 (pre-1985.5), the sunroof relay is on the main relay and fuse panel. It is the second relay from the left on the top row of relays. On late model 944s, the sunroof main relay is G18 on the central electric panel. Check for proper supply voltage to the main relay as follows: a. On early 944 sunroofs, insert the key into the ignition but, do not turn the switch on. On late 944 sunroofs, turn the ignition to the ACCESSORY position. b. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal R of the sunroof relay socket. c. On early and late 944s, turn the ignition switch to the ON position. d. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal A and terminal R of the sunroof relay socket. 5. If the correct supply voltages are present and the correct output voltages are not present, the main sunroof relay is most likely faulty and needs to be replaced. 6. If the correct output voltages are present, the main sunroof relay is functioning sufficiently to raise and lower the sunroof and to release the lifting arms for sunroof removal. Page 7 of 16 NOTE There is one remaining check on the main sunroof relay performance. This has to do with the function of the lifting arms to raise from the retracted position to the locked position if the sunroof is installed and the car's speed is sensed to be greater than 5 km/h (3 mph). This can be performed by checking for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 5 of the console switch plug with the car rolling at greater than the required speed. On early 944s (pre-1985.5) this can be done by raising the front of the car and spinning the left front wheel. The 5 km/h is sensed by a hall sensor on the left front wheel. On late 944s, the speed signal comes from the electronic speedometer signal from the hall sensor mounted in the transaxle. So, the car has to be driven or the rear of the car has to be raised and the transaxle rotated to check the voltage. Limit Switch Testing Introduction The sunroof limit switches are a common source of problems with sunroof operation. However, there are fewer problems associated with the limit switches than are often attributed to them. On early 944 sunroofs, the limit switches are located at the back of the sunroof drive cable guide rail. The rail extends from the sunroof motor toward the rear of the car. The limit switches are located on the back side of the rail. The top limit switch is Limit Switch 1 and the bottom is Limit Switch 2. On the late model sunroof system the limit switches are located almost directly above the sunroof motor. The bottom limit switch is Limit Switch I and the top is Limit Switch II. Below are diagrams showing the early and late model sunroof limit switches and wiring connections and a table showing the limit switch positions and terminal readings for the various sunroof positions.

Disconnect the sunroof switch plug as follows: a. Remove the storage pocket underneath the radio. This can be done by sliding both hands into the pocket, and pressing outward on the sides of the pocket with your hands while pulling the pocket straight out of the console. This will expose two Phillips head screws which you'll need to remove. b. Remove the ash tray from the center console by pulling it straight up out of the console and remove the two Phillips head screws at the back of the console. c. Lift up on the console insert. You may have to remove the trim piece from around the radio to remove the console insert. d. There are two plastic tabs on either side of the console switch which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when releasing these tabs as they can easily be broken. Nothing will make you more angry than having to replace a perfectly good switch because you've broken off the tabs. The way I release the tabs is to slide small flat tip screwdrivers under both tabs on both Page 11 of 16 sides simultaneously. This releases all four tabs at the same time and the plug should slide off the switch easily. 2. The console switch can be tested while it is still in the console insert. However, if you desire to remove and test it or if the switch has been tested and determined to be faulty, remove it as follows: a. There is a tab on either side of the console switch that holds it into the console insert. Use extreme caution when removing any console switch as the retaining tabs are easily broken. Page 12 of 16 b. Insert a small flat tip screwdriver into the opening on the console insert to depress the tab on the switch while gently pulling outward on the switch. c. Often the switch will come out by just releasing the tab on one side of the switch and swinging it out of the holder. However, if you feel any resistance, depress the tab on the other side of the switch to release it and slide it out of the holder. d. When re-installing the switch or installing a new switch, slide it straight into the holder on the back of the console insert. Console Switch Testing The pictures shown for this section are for an early 944 sunroof system console switch. However, the function and switch terminal labelling is identical for the late model sunroof system console switch. Page 13 of 16 When the sunroof switch is depressed in the BACK (A) direction, the resistance readings between terminals 2-5 and terminals 1-3 on the console switch should be less than 1 ohm. When the switch is depressed it the FORWARD (B) direction, the resistance readings between terminals 2-6 and terminals 2-4 should be less than 1 ohm. If the proper readings are obtained, the sunroof switch is good. Directional Relay Testing If one or both of the sunroof directional relays is bad, the sunroof will typically not operate in any direction. However, it is possible for the sunroof to operate in one direction and not the other with one bad directional relay. Therefore, when testing the directional relays, it's a good idea to test both relays at the same time. Testing 1. Remove both sunroof directional relays from the terminal block near the sunroof motor (see picture above). The relays can be difficult to remove and it may be necessary to pry gently with a small flat tip screwdriver along the bottom edge of the relay to free it from the terminal block. If so, use extreme caution when trying to pry up the relay as the terminal (87) closest to the outside of the car (later sunroof systems) on each relay will always have 12 VDC present. NOTE The directional relay terminals should be clearly labelled on the bottom of the relay. 2. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 30 and 87a on the relay. The resistance read across those terminals should be less than 1 ohm. 3. Connect a DC voltage source to the relay (a 9V battery is normally sufficient) with the DC positive lead connected to terminal 85 of the relay and the DC negative lead connected to terminal 86. You should hear an audible click from the relay. The resistance now read across terminals 30 and 87a of the relay should be . Page 14 of 16 4. Move the ohmmeter lead from terminal 87a to terminal 87 of the relay. The resistance should read less than 1 ohm. 5. Disconnect the DC voltage source from the relay. You should again hear an audible click. The resistance between terminals 30 and 87 should now read . 6. If all of the resistance checks on the relay are good, the relay is functioning normally. While checking the directional relays, it's also a good idea to check that the voltage supply to the relay terminal block is good and that the wiring connections from the relay block to ground are good. These insure checks ensure that the relay will function properly provided it gets a signal from the sunroof switch to actuate. On early 944 sunroof systems, install the ignition key into the ignition (not required on later sunroof cars). With a multimeter, you should read 12 VDC on both terminal 87s to ground and less than 1 ohm resistance between the 86 terminals to ground and 87a terminals to ground. If the voltage reading on the 87 terminals is bad, check the following: · · On later sunroof cars, check fuse #1 on the central electrical panel. On early sunroof cars, check fuse #9 on the additional fuse panel. If fuse #9 is good, check fuse #6 on the main fuse panel. Sunroof Motor Testing Testing the sunroof motor is only necessary if the sunroof motor will not run and all of the other associated tests are satisfactory. To test the sunroof motor simply disconnect the sunroof motor plug connector and connect an external 12 VDC voltage supply. Ignition Switch Testing If the main sunroof relay does not test satisfactorily, it may be due to a faulty power supply to the the relay. This is most likely due to a faulty ignition switch or wiring between the ignition switch and relay. Page 15 of 16 Ignition Switch - Early Sunroof Cars 1. Insert the key into the ignition switch. 2. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; on the main sunroof relay socket. 3. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position and check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 15 on the sunroof relay socket. Ignition Switch - Late Sunroof Cars 1. Turn the ignition switch to the ACCESSORY position. 2. Check for approximately 12 VDC at terminals &quot;A&quot; and &quot;R&quot; on the main sunroof relay socket. 3. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position and check for approximately 12 VDC at terminal 15 on the sunroof relay socket. Clark's Garage © 1998 Page 16 of 16");sQ1[350]=new Array("pdf-manual/body-04.pdf","Sunroof Gear Replacement","","BODY-04, Sunroof - Plastic Gear Replacement Parts Part Plastic Sunroof Gear (Feb. 1986 - 1991) Procedure The first step in replacing the plastic gears in the late model 944 sunroof is to determine whether one or both of the gears are stripped. If only one of the gears is stripped, it simplifies the replacement process. The gear which has not been stripped can be use as a reference for setting the other lifting arm. First remove the sunroof from the car. If necessary operate the sunroof manually to retract the lifting arms for removal. If you haven't located the motor assembly yet, it is behind the vertical section of carpet in the rear hatch area (behind the hatch compartment light). The carpet is held in place by plastic push plugs. You should be able to slide your fingers behind the carpet and gently pull out to get the plugs out. Your sunroof motor assembly may or may not have a black plastic cover over it. The cover has four Phillips head screws that hold it in place. There is a black plastic cone shaped dust cover on the drive assembly at the base of the motor. Behind the cover, there are three nuts. The outer two nuts are for adjusting the torque for the motor's slip clutch. The large one in back (21mm) can be turned to move the cable/cam. It is also used to check the torque of the sunroof motor's slip clutch and also how you raise and lower the sunroof if the motor fails. If the nut is rotated in the clockwise direction, it will retract the lifting arms so that the sunroof can be removed. Rotate just enough to get the sunroof out. If one of the gears is still good and the torque on the slip clutch is too high, retracting the lifting arm against the back of the roof may strip the remaining gear. The next step is to disassemble the headliner to get to the lifting arms. There is a cover on the back part of the headliner which is held in place by Phillips head screws. The screws should Part Number 944-564-430-01 Page 1 of 4 have plastic covers over them which will have to be pried off to get to the screws. It's easiest to do this with the back seat down and the rear hatch raised while lying on your back in the luggage compartment. Pull back the weather-stripping along the top edge of the hatch. This will expose the back edge of the headliner which is wrapped around the edge of the body. Gently pull the headliner loose from the body all the way across the edge of the hatch. This will expose the lifting arm mechanisms. If you have the new style lifting assembly, there will be the two lifting arm boxes with a single drive cable guide tube along the bottom of both mechanisms. If there is a box between the two mechanisms with several different guide tubes, you have the old style mechanism. This procedure does not cover the old style mechanism. Carefully remove the lifting arm covers (one at a time) and inspect the gears. Try to keep the gear and the lifting arm from falling out when you remove the cover. If the gear is still good you will be able to use it as a reference for setting the other lifting arm. If one of the gears is good replace the cover. Remove the lifting arm and plastic gear for the ones that are bad. There is a metal washer on the back of the plastic gear which you will need to retain for reinstallation. The grease in the mechanism may cause it to stick in the mechanism housing instead of coming out with the gear. Next, set the sunroof motor assembly so that micro-switch I is made and micro-switch II is not. Here's how you do it. Once the sunroof motor cover is removed you can see the sunroof motor and two of the three limit switches. On the back side of the motor assembly is a white plastic cam that is attached to the end of the cable that operates the lifting arms. As the motor drives the cable, the cam rotates and hits the different microswitches to stop the lifting arms. The sunroof motor is mounted on its side and has a round drive assembly at one end. With the ignition switch in position 2 and the sunroof installed, depress the up arrow on the console switch until the motor stops. Then depress the down arrow on the console switch until the motor stop. At the motor assembly, there are two micro-switches above the motor. There is a small opening behind the microswitches that you can see through. If the cam is set properly, you should be able to see the white plastic cam hitting the arm on the bottom micro-switch (should be labeled I). The cam should not yet have hit the arm on the other micro-switch (labeled II). If you are unsure if it is properly set, you can adjust it manually and listen for the micro-switch to click. If you turn the nut counterclockwise the cam will rotate toward the left away from the micro-switch arms. This is just like raising the sunroof. Turn it counter clockwise enough so that you're sure the cam is not hitting the micro-switch. Then turn it back clockwise until it hits the bottom micro-switch arm. You should hear it click. While you're at it, you may want to rotate the cam far enough clockwise to hear micro-switch II click. This isn't a guarantee that both micro-switches are working electrically, but it does verify that they are working mechanically. Once you've done this, set the cam back to where that just micro-switch I (bottom) is made. This is the correct position for the Page 2 of 4 sunroof in the locked position. The reason for verifying that both micro-switch switches click is that the micro-switch mounting assembly sometimes bends so that the cam will not make the micro-switches. If this happens you will have to remove the micro-switches and bend the mounting arm slightly so that the cam will make the micro-switches. The next thing to do is to mark the lifting arms for installation. If you look at the tracks on the sunroof that the lifting arms slide in to, you'll see a sharp bend almost like a knee. The middle of the curve of the knee is where the round peg on the lifting arm sits when the roof is in the locked position. With the roof installed and closed, lay one of the lifting arms in the track in the lifting element where in normally sits. The lifting element is the box that the lifting arm and the plastic gear sit in. Don't install the gear yet. Slide the element up into the track in the roof until the round peg is in the middle of the knee in the track. Put a mark on the lifting arm where it is lined up with the edge of the lifting element. Bright finger nail polish works well. Remove the lifting arm and mark the other lifting arm in the same spot. You can measure using a ruler, count the teeth on the lifting arm, or hold them side by side to figure out where to mark the other gear. If you've had sunroof gears strip, one of the critical things you must do is check the torque on the slip clutch. On later style sunroofs, this should be after installing and adjust the gears but before operating the roof to the full open or fully retracted position using the motor. Refer to BODY-03 for slip clutch adjustment. Now we're ready to install the gears. Remove the sunroof from the car. There should have been a thin metal washer on the back of the old gears. If it is not there it is probably still in the lifting element body. Make sure you put this washer on the back of the new gear before installing. Lubricate the gear with grease before installing. Porsche calls for a special grease (TL-VW 745 Universal Cold Grease). It should be available at the Porsche or Volkswagen dealer. I've never bought the special grease. I just use a good quality, fairly heavy grease. You don't need to apply an excessive amount. Install the gear in the lifting element housing. Insert the lifting arm so the mark on the lifting arm lines up with the edge of the housing (as we had previously measured). Screw the cover in place. Repeat for the other side. With the ignition key in position 1, carefully bump the up arrow on the console switch and watch the lifting arms. They should retract toward the lifting element housing as if you were going to remove the sunroof from the car. Be VERY careful here. Make sure that as you bump the lifting arms toward the retracted position, the round pegs on the lifting arms reach the element housing at the same time. When the pegs hit the housing, it acts as a mechanical stop. Due to uneven loading, the gears may strip if the arms do not hit the mechanical stop at the same time. Once you're sure everything is aligned and working correctly, install the sunroof and you're ready to go. I try to made sure the lifting arms are set perfectly and that the torque for the slip clutch is a little low. My gears have been in for about a year and have not stripped yet. And I remove my roof a lot in the summer time. When I first started working on sunroofs, I stripped several sets of gears while trying to get the arms set Page 3 of 4 correctly. However, this was also before I knew how to check the torque on the slip clutch. That's why I told you to order two sets of gears. It's just a little insurance. I always like to keep a spare set of gears handy anyway. If you find that the roof doesn't lock down tight enough (i.e. the pegs on the arms aren't hitting the right part of the knee in the track) you can adjust this by moving the two micro-switches forward or backward. If you move them forward, the arm will stop more toward the released position. If you move them backward, they will stop more toward the raised position. Clark's Garage © 1998 Page 4 of 4");sQ1[351]=new Array("pdf-manual/susp-15.pdf","Suspension Information and Upgrades","","SUSP-15, Suspension Information and Upgrades Introduction The intent of this article is to provide a discussion regarding suspension dynamics in general and information regarding potential upgrades to the 944 suspension. Suspension Dynamics To optimize the performance of your car's suspension it's essential to have an understanding of suspension dynamics. This includes and understanding of the concepts of &quot;oversteer&quot; and &quot;understeer&quot; and what must be done to correct these conditions when necessary. Now, I'm sure many of you know what oversteer and understeer are, but you may not have a complete understanding of what causes these conditions. Still others may have no idea what understeer and oversteer are. So, we'll start by discussing some suspension basics and work our way on from there. If you follow any type of auto racing, you may have overheard conversations between the driver and pit crew where the driver tells the crew that the car is &quot;pushing&quot; or the car is &quot;loose&quot;. There are actually referring to understeer (push) and oversteer (loose) conditions. During hard cornering the weight of the car shifts away from the inside wheels toward the outside wheels. The softer the suspension, the more weight is transferred to the outside wheels. The added weight on the outside wheels causes the outside tires to grip better allowing the car to steer safely through the turn. With a perfectly &quot;neutral&quot; suspension setup, the weight would transfer such that the front and rear tires would have the same amount of grip and, at the limit, both tires would lose traction at the same time. If the suspension is set up so that, during cornering more weight is shifted to the outside rear tire than the outside front tire, then the rear tire will have more grip during cornering than the front tire. So, the front tire will lose traction before the rear. This is referred to as understeer. The effect is that the car takes a wider radius curve than the drive intended. The reason you hear this referred to as &quot;pushing&quot; is that the driver feels the rear of the car trying to push the car off of it's intended line. Conversely, if the suspension is set up so that, during cornering more weight is shifted to the outside front tire than the outside rear tire, then the front tire will have more grip during cornering than the rear tire. So, the rear tire will lose traction before the front. This is referred to as oversteer or as the car being &quot;loose&quot;. The effect is that the rear wheels steer a wider path than the front wheels, rotating the car more than the driver intended, forcing the car into a smaller radius turn. Page 1 of 11 Most passenger car suspensions are designed with a certain amount of understeer (including the 944) because it is much safer than oversteer. If the car understeers, the car makes a wider turn than intended, but the car remains stable. If the car oversteers, the car makes a smaller radius turn. This increases the cornering force on the outside wheels which brings the rear wheels even closer to the point of losing traction. This results in even more oversteer. If no correction is made, the situation will continue to become worse until the rear wheels lose grip completely, the car spins, and all control is lost. Realize that the above discussion assumes a constant velocity during cornering. Even in a car with a completely neutral suspension setup, you can induce oversteer or understeer via acceleration or braking during cornering. And, the effects of acceleration are different depending on whether the car has FWD or RWD. Ideal Setup? So, the big question you might ask right now is &quot;What is the ideal suspension response oversteer, understeer, or neutral?&quot; The answer - all three. During straight line acceleration, a slight amount of understeer is desirable because it makes the car very stable, requiring few driver corrections to keep the car moving in a straight line. At the turn in point, you again want a slight understeer to keep the car stable while the brakes are being let off and cornering forces are building up. Through the apex, neutral steering is desirable as the car's cornering traction is at is maximum and it allows the car to drift through the corner should you come in a bit too hot (instead of having the front or rear lose traction in the middle of the turn). And finally, at the turn-out a slight amount of oversteer is desirable to allow the car to take a tighter path through the turn-out. Slip Angle and Suspension Dynamics Now we're going talk about oversteer and understeer using a new term called slip angle. The concept of slip angle is a little more complex. However, understanding slip angles is essential to understanding how acceleration and braking affect steering. When you're driving along in a straight line the car, wheels, and tires (including the tread on the tires) are all moving in the same direction. However, when you make a turn, the treads on the tire which are in contact with the ground (contact patch) resist the turning action due to friction between the tire and the ground. Due to the elasticity of the tires, the tread will distort creating an angular difference between the treads in the contact patch and the direction the wheel is turned. This angular difference is referred to as slip angle. Page 2 of 11 When more weight is transferred to a particular tire, the slip angle increases because the tread in the contact patch area develops a higher resistance to turning (due to the increase in friction between the contact patch and the ground). So, when the slip angle of the rear tires is greater than the front tires you have oversteer. Likewise, when the slip angle of the front tires is greater than the rear you have understeer. And finally, when the slip angles are the same, you have neutral steer. So you ask, &quot;where is all this leading?&quot; Bear with me and hopefully it will all become a bit clearer shortly. Steering Response Under Acceleration As I mentioned before, acceleration and braking have an effect on steering dynamics. If we consider a neutral steering car that is cornering and we accelerate the car, tractive force from the engine is applied to the drive wheels. Tractive force is the force applied by the engine necessary to overcome the force of gravity and cause the car to move. This force is ultimately felt between the tire and the ground which causes the tread on the contact patch (already distorted from turning) to distort even more, thus increasing the slip angle for the drive wheels. As we stated, if the car had neutral steering before acceleration was applied, it will cause oversteer in a RWD car (increased slip angle in the rear tires) and understeer in a FWD car (increased slip angle in the front tires). Is it starting to make sense? Page 3 of 11 Steering Response Under Braking During braking, there is a weight shift from the rear of the car toward the front of the car. This applies more weight to the front tires increasing the front tire slip angle and inducing oversteer. In this particular case, it's very easy to put the rear of the car into a spin if you enter a corner carrying too much speed, panic, and get on the brakes. The effect is similar if you're on the throttle in a fast corner and suddenly lift (take your foot off the gas). 911s are particularly bad about spinning out the rear if you lift in a turn due to the high concentration of weight behind the rear wheels. At my first PCA Driver Education event, the only two cars I saw get in trouble were 911s drivers who lifted in a corner. BTW, the driver's were DE instructors. Handling Corrections Now that we've discussed what oversteer and understeer are and what causes each, let's take a look at what can be done to correct oversteer or understeer conditions. Understeer Corrections Front Suspension Softer front springs Thinner or no front sway bar Raise front tire pressure Softer front shocks More negative front camber Remove weight from the front Wider tires in the front More positive caster. Rear Suspension Stiffer rear springs Rear sway bar or a thicker one Lower rear tire pressure Stiffer rear shocks More positive rear camber Add weight to the rear More down force in the front Less down force in the rear Narrower tires in the rear Limited slip rear differential or stiffer rear diff Page 4 of 11 Oversteer Corrections Front Suspension Stiffer front springs Front sway bar or a thicker one Lower front tire pressure More positive front camber Add weight to the front Less down force in the front Narrower tires in the front Stiffer front shocks 944 Suspension and Handling Setups Now that we've discussed the basics of handling in general, let's take a look at specific setups for the 944. There are a number of different ways to approach suspension setup. There are no hard and fast rules about combinations of springs, sway bars, and torsion bars. To find the right combination for what you want to do with the car, it may involve a lot of trial and error. Bottom line is it's all about establishing and maintaining a relative balance between the front and rear suspension such that there's not too much understeer nor too much oversteer. Ideally, you want the steering to be as neutral as possible. For 944s, and almost all street cars in general, the car is going to have some amount of understeer from the factory. The reason is that when a car oversteers, your normal &quot;street driver&quot; tend to get into trouble more frequently with a car that oversteers as they tend to overcorrect in panic situations on the street. Therefore, understeer is considered safer. Driver's who spend a lot of time on the track tend to want a car that is neutral or has a slight oversteer and they get a better feel for how the car is handling under those conditions and hence can maintain better control over the car when driving it at it's limits. Rear Suspension Softer rear springs Thinner or no rear sway bar Higher rear tire pressure More negative rear camber Remove weight from the rear More down force in the rear Wider Tires in the rear Softer rear shocks Page 5 of 11 To gain some perspective on making changes to the 944 suspension, it's valuable to first look at several stock suspension setup and discuss their performance characteristics under different conditions. The information in this table was obtained from a suspension article in Excellence magazine written by Jim Pasha.

Realize that this is based on solid torsion bars. For hollow torsion bars, the spring rate is based on the outside diameter of the torsion bar and the diameter of the hollow area inside the bar. For these bars, you'll have to get the spring rate from the manufacturer. Torsion Bar Rates Diameter 22.0 22.5 23.0 23.5 24.0 24.5 25.0 25.5 26.0 27.0 28.0 29.0 30.0 31.0 32.0 33.0 Spring Rate (lbs./in) 97 106 116 126 137 149 161 175 189 220 254 292 335 382 434 490 Notice that some of the rates for the front springs in the first table are given in lbf and some are given in Newtons (N). For the rates given in lbs., it's for an uncompressed spring. For the rates given in Newtons, it's for springs compressed to their normal operating height. As the compressed height may vary from vehicle-to-vehicle comparing the spring rates above are useful only to the point of comparing one vehicle to another. So, without some fixed point of reference how do we know what kinds of changes to make to our suspension? Page 8 of 11 Basically, changing to higher spring rates for the front springs, torsion bars, and sway bars can benefit all vehicles in the 924/944/968 model line. The main benefit of changing to higher spring rates is reducing body roll during cornering. By reducing body roll, the tires maintain contact with the road longer. Other benefits are reduced squat during acceleration and reduced dive during hard braking. Regardless of the spring rates listed above (in lbs. or Newtons), the maximum spring rate for any 924/944/968 suspension is approximately 175 lbs. So, we need to pick a spring that is something greater than 175 lbs. if we want to improve handling. So, exactly how much do we increase the spring rate? Generally, spring rates from 200 to 220 lbs. provide a good performance improvement cars that are primarily street driven. For street cars that see some track time, spring rates from 250-275 lbs. are an excellent choice. I have seen some cars where 400 lb. springs are used on street/track cars. In my opinion, 400 lb. springs are entirely too stiff for a street driven car. They provide much too harsh a ride on the street. More importantly, as streets are generally much less smooth and hence much less forgiving than a track, they can in fact be dangerous on the street. To give you some idea of the stiffness of a 400 lb. spring, 944 Turbo Cup cars used 375-410 lb. progressive rate springs. Example Suspension Setups Sport Suspension A good sport suspension setup for a car that is primarily driven on the street might include 220 lb. front springs, 27 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Personally, I like a car that has very neutral steering characteristics. If you prefer to maintain the understeering characteristics of the stock 944, you might prefer a 26 mm sway bar to the 27 mm. If you prefer a car that oversteers, you might choose a 28 mm torsion bar. Just realize that a car that oversteers is much more sensitive to steering corrections and can you into trouble during a panic maneuver. With regards to the sway bars, I really like the 968 M030 sway bars. The reason I like them is that the 19 mm rear bars are 3-way adjustable which give you another option when it comes to changing the steering characteristics. High Performance Street/Track Suspension A good high performance suspension for a car that it used on the street and track might include 260 lb. springs, a 28 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Again, if you want more understeer, you might choose a 27 mm torsion bar. And, if you want some oversteer, you might choose a 29 mm torsion bar. As I've already cautioned you about oversteer we won't repeat that again. Page 9 of 11 Full Race Suspension While I've seen this suspension setup used on the street, I don't recommend it. A good combination for the track might include 400 lb. front springs, 31 mm torsion bar, 30 mm front sway bar, and 19 mm rear sway bar. Additional Suspension Notes and Suggestions When you decide to change the suspension of a 944 and you make the decision to change the torsion bars, you have to realize that changing a torsion bar yourself is not necessarily a job for the novice mechanic. It's not that the job is all that difficult. It is very tedious because the torsion bars must be properly indexed to achieve the proper ride height. Indexing the torsion bars may involve a lot of trial and error to get the proper ride height which includes driving the car at a given torsion bar index for a day or so to allow the suspension to settle. For that reason, it may be more practical to go to a suspension setup that uses coil over shocks in the rear and remove the torsion bars completely. It is also becoming more common to see suspensions that use a combination of torsion bars and coil over shocks in the rear to achieve an overall rear spring rate that will balance whatever springs you use in the front. By doing that, you can leave the rear torsion bars alone and simply choose a coil over shock to match your new spring rate in the front. However, if you choose to do away with the torsion bars or use a torsion bar/coil over combination, you must select a coil over shock that has adjustable spring perches so that you can adjust the ride height. The primary disadvantage of going to a coil over setup in the rear is that it's much more expensive than simply changing the rear torsion bar. Up to this point, we really haven't discussed shocks or struts at all. The factory shocks and struts are adequate for street use. However, I like an adjustable sport shock/strut setup, even for street use. Personally, I prefer Koni Sport shocks/struts because that's what I've become accustomed to over the years. However, Bilstein makes good sport shocks/struts as well. For use on the track, a full coil over setup (front and rear) is the only way to go in my opinion. Page 10 of 11 Closing Comments Realize that, due to the large number of variables that can affect a car's handling, no two cars are going to respond exactly the same to the same change in suspension components. Likewise, no two drivers will have the exact same feel for the same suspension. The idea is to get to a suspension setup that is right for you. What's right for you may not be right for me. The suggested setups above should get you close to a fairly neutral handling setup. However, it may not get your car exactly where you want your handling to be. From there you should be able to &quot;tweak&quot; the suspension feel to get to &quot;your&quot; suspension setup by making minor changes in weight distribution, shock stiffness (assuming you go with adjustable shocks/struts), camber, caster, and tire pressure. Hope this article gives you some idea as to what direction to head with your suspension modifications. Drive it like you stole it!

Overcooling problems are causes by a thermostat that is stuck open while overheating problems by a thermostat that is either stuck closed or does not open at the correct coolant temperature. There are two different thermostats for the 924S, 944, and 944 Turbo. The correct thermostat is determined by whether you have a new type water pump or old type water pump. With the old style thermostat, the groove for the thermostat snap ring is 4.5 mm from the thermostat sealing surface inside the water pump housing. With the new style, the groove is 7 mm from the sealing surface.

Because they can result in such a large number of problems, faulty switches often go undiagnosed. The other thing that makes TPS problems difficult to diagnose is that they quite often only appear when the engine is warmed up (throttle position switch warmed up). The following lists some of the symptoms that MAY indicate a problem with the throttle position switch: · · · · · · · Poor idle - particularly a high idle condition Engine cuts out to an idle condition during acceleration Poor power at various RPMs (various throttle positions) Surging idle Misfire Stumble during acceleration Intermittent boost problems (turbocharged cars) Tools · · · Multimeter Test leads Phillips screwdriver Testing Page 1 of 5 NOTE On 1985.5 and newer cars, the DME control unit is located behind the kick panel in the passenger's footwell. For pre-1985.5 cars, the DME is located under the dash on the driver's side. For 8V Normally Aspirated cars: 1. Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME. 2. Connect an ohmmeter between terminal 2 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will test the idle speed contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). 3. Connect the ohmmeter between terminal 3 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will test the wide open throttle (WOT) contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read infinite (). With the throttle wide open the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. The switch in resistance should occur just before the throttle reaches full open. Page 2 of 5 4. If reading at the DME plug are unsatisfactory, the test should be repeated at the switch. This will require removing the throttle body from the car. The ohmmeter should be connected between the center terminal on the switch (ground) and each of the outer terminals (2 and 3) and resistance values checked as described above. For 16V Normally Aspirated cars: NOTE The 16V N/A cars use the same TPS as the early cars. Pictures of the 16V DME plug will be available in a few days. 1. Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME. 2. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 52 and 24 on the DME wiring harness plug. This will test the idle speed contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read 0 - 10 ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). 3. Connect the ohmmeter between terminals 53 and 24 on the DME wiring harness plug. This will test the wide open throttle (WOT) contact. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read infinite (). With the throttle approximately 2/3 open, the ohmmeter should read zero (0) ohms. Page 3 of 5 4. If reading at the DME plug are unsatisfactory, the test should be repeated at the switch. This will require removing the throttle body from the car. The ohmmeter should be connected between the center terminal on the switch (ground) and each of the outer terminals (2 and 3) and resistance values checked as described above. For turbocharged cars: 1. Disconnect the electrical connector for the DME control unit. 2. Connect an ohmmeter between terminal 2 on the DME wiring harness plug and ground. This will check the idle contact. 3. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read between 0 - 10 ohms. With the throttle open, the ohmmeter should read infinite (). The switch in resistance must occur as soon as the throttle starts to open (approximately 1°). 4. Disconnect the electrical connector for the KLR control unit. 5. Connect an ohmmeter between terminals 22 and 23 on the KLR wiring harness plug. With the throttle closed, the ohmmeter should read between 320 - 670 ohms. 6. Slowly open the throttle to the wide open throttle (WOT) position. As the throttle opens, the resistance should continuously increase to full open resistance without any breaks. Full open resistance is 2.7 - 4.7 Kohms. Replacement and Adjustment Normally Aspirated cars: 1. Remove the throttle body from the car. 2. Remove the two Phillips head screws that attach the TPS to the throttle body. 3. Install the new TPS and insert the mounting screws. Do not tighten the screws until the adjustment is complete. 4. Hold the throttle in the closed position and turn the TPS until the internal stop is felt and tighten the mounting screws. 5. Check the adjustment by turning the throttle toward the open position. An audible click should be hear as soon as the throttle starts to open. Slowly close the throttle until it is fully closed. Do not force the throttle closed. Allow it to close under spring pressure only. Just prior to going fully closed, an audible click should again be heard. If the click is not heard, readjust the switch. 6. Install the throttle body. Page 4 of 5 Turbocharged cars: NOTE On turbocharged cars, the throttle body does not have to be removed from the car. However, the bottom mounting screw for the TPS is extremely difficult to remove and install. So, I always replace the Phillips head screws the 4 mm Allen head bolts. They are much easier to remove and install than the Phillips screws - especially if you have a long ball head Allen tool. 1. Remove the two Phillips head screws that attach the TPS to the throttle body. 2. Install the new TPS and insert the mounting screws. Do not tighten the screws until the adjustment is complete. 3. Hold the throttle in the closed position and turn the TPS until the internal stop is felt and tighten the mounting screws. 4. Check the adjustment by turning the throttle toward the open position. An audible click should be hear as soon as the throttle starts to open. Slowly close the throttle until it is fully closed. Do not force the throttle closed. Allow it to close under spring pressure only. Just prior to going fully closed, an audible click should again be heard. If the click is not heard, readjust the switch.

Procedure 1. This procedure can be performed by one person. However, it is much easier to perform with two people. 2. At the back of the engine compartment, looking from the left side of the car, locate the square opening (window) in the top of the clutch housing. 3. You will be looking for the letters &quot;OT&quot; to appear in the opening as the engine is rotated. Note: The crankshaft should not be rotated, manually or otherwise, unless the timing belt is installed with timing properly set or the camshaft housing assembly removed. This is done to prevent valve/piston damage. 4. Using the 15/16&quot; or 24 mm deep socket and ratchet, rotate the engine in the clockwise direction using the crankshaft pulley bolt on the front of the engine until the letters &quot;OT&quot; appear in the clutch housing window. NOTE The picture below was taken on my own car. The &quot;OT&quot; is not really visible in the clutch housing opening due to the rust on my flywheel. However, some time ago, I painted the TDC line on my flywheel with red fingernail polish so it would be clearly visible. From the angle this picture is taken it appears that the alignment mark is slightly off from the alignment tab in clutch housing but it's simply due to the angle. To correctly align the mark for TDC you need to be looking directly down on the opening. Many people have trouble locating the opening in the clutch housing for the TDC mark. You'll note in the picture the close proximity of the opening to the speed/reference sensor mounting bracket (sensors removed in this picture). Page 1 of 3 NOTE In the picture below, you'll see what the &quot;OT&quot; mark would look like on the flywheel if it is clean (unlike the previous picture). Note: If this is being performed by one person, the alignment mark on the camshaft sprocket can be used to determine when the engine is close to Top Dead Center (TDC). However, the flywheel should be used for final alignment in case the timing is off slightly. The camshaft sprocket alignment mark is visible through the opening in the front distributor housing cover just above the distributor cap. Page 2 of 3 5. When the letters &quot;OT&quot; are visible in the window, continue to rotate the engine clockwise until the scribe mark (line) beside the &quot;OT&quot; is aligned with the tab inside the window. The tab is on the side of the window closest to the middle of the car and extends down from the inside of the housing until it almost touches the flywheel. 6. If you have trouble locating the TDC mark from above, there is a 5 mm wide groove in the flywheel which can be used to locate TDC as well. It will appear in an opening in the bottom of the clutch housing near the starter. When the groove is centered in the opening the #1 cylinder is at TDC. Personally, I don't care for this method because if the groove is not centered in the opening, the timing can be off ± 1 tooth. 7. Alternatively, you can remove the #1 spark plug and insert a small diameter wooden dowel into the spark plug hole until it contacts the top of the piston. As the engine is rotated, the piston will force the dowel upward. When the end of the dowel is at its highest point, the engine is at TDC for the #1 cylinder. 8. If the engine is not in the car and the clutch housing is removed, the &quot;OT&quot; scribe mark on the flywheel will line up with a cast mark on the back of the upper crankcase section when the #1 cylinder is at TDC. 9. If the crankshaft pulley bolt needs to be removed or it is important that the engine remain at the TDC position, you'll need to install the &quot;engine in&quot; flywheel lock (9206). There is also an &quot;engine out&quot; flywheel lock (9130) which is used if the engine is on an engine stand. The engine out flywheel lock is not intended to maintain the engine at TDC but, is attached the flywheel to provide countertorque against the engine stand arms for removing/installing the crankshaft pulley bolt or removing/installing the flywheel cheesehead bolts.

Loosen the bottom shock mount. d. Disconnect wires and brake lines as necessary to lower the rear suspension without damaging them. Page 3 of 11 e. You can now lower the rear suspension. However, the rear brake lines will limit the amount that you can lower the suspension. You may have to disconnect the brake lines to obtain enough clearance to remove the torque tube. Resting the lower suspension on blocks or bricks works well. NOTE 8. It may be necessary to remove the starter and slave cylinder in order to access all the bolts / fasteners for the torque tube and torque tube carrier. 9. Remove the four bolts that connect the torque tube to the clutch housing. 10. Disconnect the torque tube carriers. Page 4 of 11 11. Lower the torque tube and move towards the rear of the car. If you're working with a late model 944 (dog ears on the torque tube), you will have to rotate the torque 180° to remove it from the car. Page 5 of 11 Rebuilding 1. Measure the distance from the transmission end of the drive shaft to the bellhousing end of the tube and record it. This is so the drive shaft end can later be reinstalled to the correct depth in the torque tube. 2. Get a 6 foot long piece of standard black or galvanized 1/2&quot; steel plumbing pipe at the hardware store. Slip the end of this pipe over the pilot diameter at the front of the drive shaft. 3. Use a large hammer to pound the shaft out, towards the bellhousing side of the torque tube. The steel plumbing pipe is soft and will not damage the heat-treated splined drive shaft. 4. Once the shaft has been removed, you will need the following: o A 6-foot long 3/4-10 threaded rod o Five 3/4-10 nuts o Two thick flat washers which will fit inside the tube I.D. and reasonably close to the O.D. of the threaded rod (I used heavy-duty fender washers). I went to Lowe's in their specialty bolts section. o A flat bar or spacer of steel with a 1&quot; hole in it (I used an old go-cart engine sprocket - anything which has a 1&quot; hole in it and is larger than the small end of the torque tube which can be pressed against without deflecting will work). Page 6 of 11 5. Slide the spacer or the large washer on one end of the threaded rod, then lock two nuts together near the end of the rod. You may find it works well to place a large socket in front of the washers to act as a &quot;driver&quot; to pull the bearings out. 6. Slide the rod into the tranny bellhousing end of the torque tube. 7. Put the go-cart pulley or the flat bar with 1&quot; hole onto the protruding end of the threaded rod at the front of the torque tub 8. Add a washer and nut. This nut will be held stationary with a wrench. Alternatively, if you have a welder, you can tack weld the nut to the flat bar. 9. Lock two nuts together at the protruding end of the threaded rod in front of the torque tube. 10. Hold the ¾&quot; nut which bears against the pulley or flat bar with a 1&quot; hole with a wrench. Page 7 of 11 11. Use an impact wrench to &quot;spin&quot; the two locked nuts at the front of the threaded rod, spinning it counterclockwise. This drags the washer at the bellhousing end forward, accumulating the 4 bearings as it goes. Can also do this by hand, but it takes forever. Alternatively, if you don't have an impact wrench, you can simply turn the ¾&quot; nut against the flat bar with an open end or combination wrench. Again, it will take a long time. The picture below shows a puller with a flat bar on the end and one with a go-cart pulley. 12. After so many turns (a million), presto - out pop all 4 torque tube bearing assemblies. Page 8 of 11 NOTES After removing these, their construction is evident - they are standard sealed ball bearings FAG 6006 2Z that are pressed into stamped steel carriers with rubber splines molded onto the O.D. There are also little rubber-covered inner sleeves that are pressed into the I.D. of the sealed bearings, that are staked in 4 places. You need to &quot;unstake&quot; the sleeves and remove them, then press the bearings out of the carriers, and press in new ones. On older 944s, the bearing carriers are twopieces that are riveted together. You'll need to drill the rivets out and separate the two halves of the carrier to remove the bearing. If the rubber coated inner sleeves are intact, once you've pressed them out of the bearings, save them for reuse. However, if they are shattered or are in otherwise poor condition, you'll need to have new sleeves fabricated. I went to a machine shop to have them fabricate 4 of the inner sleeves out of Delrin plastic (see drawing below). Page 9 of 11 I used a hydraulic press to install the new bearings and inner sleeves. 13. Install the bearing assemblies and drive shaft in the torque tube as follows:. a. Measure and mark 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th bearing locations in the torque tube with 1st in front. Use bearing marks in the shaft. b. All 4 bearing housings must be in same orientation. Look at the attached dwg. Position inner sleeve in a way it will not come out when the shaft is driven from the front end of torque tube. Whether you are reusing the old sleeves or using new ones. c. Install 2nd bearing in the front end using the 3/4&quot; all threaded rod until it is in the second bearing mark. Then do the 1st bearing. d. Then install the 3rd and 4th bearing from the back end. I did it this way so I don't have to install one bearing from the front end all the way to the back end. That is a lot of wrenching. I put some loctite anti-seize inside the torque tube so bearing will slide easy. e. Insert the drive shaft into torque tube from the front end inserting the tranny end first. I used a plastic mallet to tap it in. Once it hit the 4th bearing it got a little stiff so I had to use a 1/2&quot; x 2&quot; pipe inserted in the pilot bearing end then hit it with a ball peen hammer (not too hard!). Position the shaft based on the measurement before disassembly. f. The key here is to have the sleeve ID to have the right tolerance fit. If it's too tight, you have to hammer the shaft really hard to drive it in thus destroying the ball bearings due to shock load during installation. If it is too loose, it may not last long and vibrate soon. Page 10 of 11 Installation 1. Slide the torque tube back into position in the vehicle. Remember, if this is a later torque tube with dog ears, the transaxle will have to be rotated 180° from its normal orientation to get it to slide into position. 2. When the torque tube is in position such that the front flange is near the clutch housing, rotate the torque tube back to its normal orientation (if it's a torque tube with dog ears). Then move the torque tube forward until the drive shaft slides into the pressure plate and clutch disc and the torque tube flange is flush with the clutch housing. Support the back end of the torque tube with a jack stand. 3. Install the torque tube carriers and the retaining bolts (4) for the torque tube to clutch housing flange. 4. Raise the rear suspension and install retaining bolts. Reattach and lines that were disconnected when the suspension was lowered. 5. Attach the lower shock mounts to the suspension. 6. Using TRANS-03, install the transaxle. 7. Install wheels and tighten lug nuts.

However, reindexing the torsion after completion is a pain and can be very time consuming. There are a couple of reasons for removing the torsion bars. The first is to make a ride height adjustment and the second is to upgrade to a stiffer torsion bar. I was fortunate enough to come across a very good torsion bar replacement procedure written by Marc Belanger to use as a guide. The following procedure is based on my own experience and the shared experiences of Marc, Doug Donsbach, and others. These combined experiences should provide you with a pretty clear picture of what it takes to remove, replace, and reindex the torsion bars in your car. I'll also be adding some pictures to help guide you along the way. Refer to the diagram below for location of the major components and fasteners for the rear suspension. First off, if you think you need to make a change in ride height, you first need to take a ride height measurement and determine how much of a change is needed. Typically, the best place to take a ride height measurement is from the ground up to the top-center of the fender well (i.e. centered on the wheel). A good number to use for ride height measurement at that point is about 25 inches (63,5 cm). It's really not a great idea to go much lower than that. And, you'll achieve the best results if you keep the same ride height front-to-rear. If you determine that a change in ride height is in order, a small amount of adjustment is available via the eccentric bolt on the trailing arm spring plate. The amount of adjustment available depends on where the eccentric is set to begin with. The total adjustment range is approximately 1 inch (2,5 cm). Assuming the eccentric is centered (seldom the case), you'll only be able to raise or lower the ride height by about 1/2 inch.

NOTE If you are simply reindexing existing torsion bars, proceed to Step 6. Steps 1-5 are only required when installing different torsion bars. 1. Raise the rear of the vehicle. 2. Using SUSP-05, remove the rear sway bar and drop links. 3. Lower the vehicle back to the ground and bounce the rear of the car several times to get the suspension to settle. 4. Fabricate a measuring device similar to the one show in the figure below to allow measurement of the position of the spring plate in relation to the torsion tube chassis mount (end cap). I believe Doug Donsbach originally came up with this idea. Basically, the device has two holes that correspond to the bottom two bolts on the end cap to give a point of reference. 5. With the vehicle sitting on the ground, measure the height of the spring plate in relation to the torsion tube end cap and mark the position on the measuring device (see below). This is the loaded spring plate height. This will be a bit awkward with the wheel in place and the car sitting on the ground. Page 3 of 13 6. Raise the rear of the vehicle and place it on jack stands. 7. Remove the rear wheels. 8. Unload the torsion bar by removing the bottom rear bolt (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 5) on the torsion bar chassis mount (end cap). 9. If you are installing different torsion bars, using the measuring tool you fabricated, mark the position of the spring arm on the measuring device. This is the unloaded spring arm position. 10. Disconnect the rear brake lines at the calipers. 11. Unplug the brake pad wear sensors. 12. Unbolt and disconnect both rear axles from their trailing arms. Hang them out of the way using bungie cords or wire. 13. Remove the bolt that attaches the trailing arm to the torsion tube bolt (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 1 - one bolt on each trailing arm). Page 4 of 13 14. Support the trailing arms from the transmission cross-member using a heavy duty strap. A good quality strap is called for as the trailing arm and rotor assembly is fairly heavy. It will become damaged, damage other components, or worse yet, injure you if it is not properly supported. The trailing arm assembly will be hanging freely when the spring plate bolts are removed in the next step. 15. Remove the nuts and bolts that hold the trailing arm to the spring plate (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 2 - three nuts and bolts on each trailing arm). Note that the back two bolts are eccentric bolts used to adjust the height of the trailing arm. You may have to tap on the end of the eccentric bolt where the retaining nut was removed to free it from the spring plate. 16. Remove the nut and bolt that holds the torsion tube cantilever arm to the chassis mount near the top of the wheel well (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 3 - one bolt and nut on each trailing arm). 17. Place the floor jack underneath the center of the torsion tube assembly. Raise the jack until it just contacts the torsion tube assembly. 18. Remove the nut and bolt that attaches the torsion tube chassis mount to the body of the vehicle (See Rear Suspension diagram Item 4 - one nut and bolt on each trailing arm chassis mount). 19. Gently pry on the torsion tube assembly, alternating sides, until the assembly is free from the body. Lower the assembly on the floor jack far enough to slide the torsion bar out of the torsion tube once the torsion tube assembly chassis mounts and spring plates are removed. 20. The torsion tube chassis mount has four bolts which attach it to the torsion tube. 21. Remove the remaining three bolts in the torsion tube chassis mount. 22. Remove the torsion tube chassis mount and spring plate. 23. Pull the torsion bar out of the torsion tube. Page 5 of 13 Replacing 1. Determine the old torsion bar loaded-to-unloaded range on the measuring device which you fabricated during the torsion bar removal (distance between the two marks). NOTE If you are replacing a solid torsion bar with a hollow torsion bar, the manufacturer should supply a solid diameter that the hollow bar is equivalent to. Use the solid bar equivalent diameter in the calculation below. Page 6 of 13 2. Calculate the new torsion bar loaded-to-unloaded range using the formula below: Example: Let's assume you currently have 25.5mm torsion bars and want to swap to 30mm bars and that the loaded-to-unloaded range on your old bar is 50mm. The loaded-to-unloaded range for your new bar would be calculated as follows: 3. Using the loaded-to-unloaded range for the new bar, measure that distance down from the loaded mark (top mark) on your measuring device and make a mark on the device at that point. This is the new bar unloaded position. 4. Install the new torsion bar into the torsion tube. 5. Install the spring plate and torsion tube end cap on to the torsion tube. Use the measuring device to check that the spring plate is aligned to the new bar unloaded position when installing the spring plate. 6. Install at least two bolts into the end cap to hold it in position while the ride height is being checked. 7. When both torsion bars have been replaced, raise the torsion tube assembly into position using the floor jack. 8. Bolt the trailing arms to the spring plates ensuring the eccentric adjusting bolt is centered. 9. Bolt the trailing arm to the torsion tube. 10. Attach the torsion tube cantilever arm to the chassis mount near the top of the wheel well. 11. Attach the torsion tube chassis mount (end cap) to the chassis. 12. Remove the vehicle from the jack stands, bounce the rear end of the car several times, and check the ride height. 13. If the ride height needs adjusting and it is with ± 1/2&quot;, adjust the eccentric bolt on the spring plate to obtain the desired ride height. Page 7 of 13 14. If the needed ride height adjustment is greater than 1/2&quot;, unbolt and lower the torsion bar assembly, reindex the torsion bars as described in the section that follows, reinstall the assembly, and check the ride height again. Repeat this as necessary until the correct ride height is obtained. Do not be surprised if it takes you three or more times to achieve the correct right height. This is very common. Also, do not be surprised if you have to reindex the bars several days after completion once everything has had a chance to settle completely. 15. Once the correct ride height is obtained, complete the reassembly by installing any remaining bolts in the torsion tube end caps and installing the rear sway bar. Indexing the Torsion Bars Indexing the torsion bars on a 944 is tedious at best, but fortunately it isn't rocket science. However, after the following explanation of how torsion bar indexing works it may seem like rocket science. If you've never studied geometry, this may completely new to you. However, bear with me and we will ultimately arrive at some formulas you will be able to use regardless of whether you understand circular geometry. First, we have to understand that in geometry a circle is divided into increments called degrees (°) and that there are 360 degrees in a complete circle. Each degree is divided into increments called minutes and there are 60 minutes (') in each degree. Now, if you examine a 944 torsion bar, you'll find that the inner end of the torsion bar has 40 splines and the outer end of the bar has 44 splines. So, if we take the number of degrees in a circle and divide it by the number of splines, will find the amount of rotation that can be obtained by moving the bar 1 spline. For the inner torsion bar end: For the outer torsion bar end: Page 8 of 13 The measured length of the trailing arm on a 944 is 16.5&quot; from the center of the torsion bar out to the center of the hub. Since we now know the length of the trailing arm and the number of degrees of rotation for each tooth of spline movement, we can now use fairly simple geometry for right triangles to calculate the change in ride height with each change in spline position. Using the formulas for right triangles below, we can calculate the change in ride height (X1). Where: A = Length of Side adjacent to angle theta () O = Length of Side opposite angle H = Length of the Hypotenuse Page 9 of 13 So, for the inner tie rod spline movement we get: Now for the part that may be a little harder to follow. This calculation is based on the assumption that we are dealing with a perfect right triangle. And, if you've ever studied geometry, you'll remember that the longest side of a right triangle is the hypotenuse. In our case with the trailing arm, the hypotenuse is simply the trailing arm moved from one position to another. Since the change in ride height calculation is based on the end of the trailing arm dropping straight down at a right angle from it's original position, our calculation is somewhat flawed. In reality, the hub end of the trailing arm swings along the arc of a circle. For it to drop straight down at a right angle from it's original position, the trailing arm would have to change length and we know that isn't possible. Unless, if course, Porsche comes up with something similar to Variocam for the suspension system. Anyway, we can still use the right triangle rules to come up with the actual ride height change if we do a few more calculations. If we calculate the length of the hypotenuse at any given angle theta, that will give us the theoretical length that the trailing arm would have to lengthen to in order to maintain our right triangle. Then, we can use the difference between the theoretical trailing arm length and the actual length to form a new (smaller) right triangle which will allow us to determine the error introduced into our original calculation. I know that's hard to visualize but, bear with me. Page 10 of 13 So, let's first calculate the length of the hypotenuse (X2) given that angle = 9° or one tooth on the inner torsion bar spline: If we take the difference between the hypotenuse length at angle and the actual trailing arm length, we obtain a length (X3) which we can use as the hypotenuse of a new (smaller) triangle. Page 11 of 13 We can now use the angle and the length of the new hypotenuse to determine the error (X4) in our original calculation. And finally, we can calculate the actual change in ride height (X5) for inner spline movement by subtracting the error (X4) from the original ride height change (X1): This is approximately 6.6 cm of change in ride height. Using the same calculations and substituting in 8.18° for angle , we obtain the actual ride height change for a single spline rotation on the outer torsion bar splines. That's roughly 6 cm. Now that we know just how much or a change in ride will occur per spline on each end of the torsion bar, let's take a look at a specific example. Assume we're standing beside the driver's side of the car looking at the torsion bar end and spring plate (see picture below). Page 12 of 13 If we leave the spring plate and chassis mount attached to the outer end of the torsion bar and rotate the inner end of the bar one spline in the counter-clockwise direction, it will raise the end of the spring plate. This will lower the ride height of the car by 2.58&quot;. Then if we leave the inner end fixed in the torsion tube and rotate the spring plate and chassis mount one spline in the clockwise direction it will lower the end of the spring plate and raise the ride height of the car by 2.35&quot;. The net result will be that the car is 0.23&quot; lower (or approximately 6mm).

There's always been a lot of discussion about what type of transaxle fluid to use in the 944 transaxle. The factory shop manual calls for hypoid transmission oil SAE 75 W 90 to API Class GL5 or MIL-L 2105 B, or SAE 80 to API Class GL or MIL-L 2105. What does all that mean? I don' t have a clue. Better, but more expensive alternatives to the standard transmission oil (IMHO) are Redline Synthetic MTL, Swepco 201, or Mobil 1 75W/90 gear oil. There was some discussion several years ago with regards to Mobil 1 gear oil attacking bronze synchros. However, there's never been anything to my knowledge to support that. Regardless of which of these three you choose, you'll probably notice a marked improvement in transmission shifting and noise, especially when the transaxle is cold.

On the 968 shifter, there's also two bushings (19) for the shifter pin which may be worn and need replacing. 1. On early 944s with carpet on the console underneath the shift lever perform the following (Refer to 944 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): a. Pull up on the bottom of the leather shift lever boot (7) to separate it from the rubber inner boot (6). b. Pull up the carpet around the rubber boot. c. Slide a small flat tip screwdriver under the edge of the trim piece at the base of the rubber boot. Push on the clips with the screwdriver to remove the trim piece. d. Pull up on the rubber shift boot to separate it from the shifter sound absorber (8). e. Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip (2) which holds the shift knob (3) to the shift lever (1). f. Pull up on the shift knob to remove the knob and boot from the shift lever. g. Remove the rubber inner boot from the shift lever. h. Go To Step 4. Page 3 of 9 2. On later 944s with plastic trim around the shifter boot perform the following (Refer to 944 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): a. Using a flat tip screwdriver gently pry around the base of the shifter boot (7) next to the console. Be careful not to damage the boot. This will separate the boot and inner trim ring from the console. b. Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip (2) which holds the shift knob (3) to the shift lever (1). c. Pull up on the shift knob to remove the knob and boot from the shift lever. d. Pull up on the rubber inner boot (6) to separate it from the shifter sound absorber (8). e. Remove the rubber vibration dampener from the shift lever. f. Remove the rubber inner boot from the shift lever. g. Go To Step 4. Page 4 of 9 3. On 968s with plastic trim around the shifter boot perform the following (Refer to 968 Shift Linkage Drawing for Location Numbers): a. Using a flat tip screwdriver gently pry around the base of the shifter boot next to the console. Be careful not to damage the boot. This will separate the boot and inner trim ring from the console. b. Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver. remove the spring clip (2) that holds the shifter knob (3) to the shift lever (1). Then pull up on the knob to remove it from the lever. c. Remove the four M6 cheesehead screws (9) that hold the shift lever bellows (6) to the top of the shifter sound absorber (8). Slide the bellows up and off of the shift lever. d. Go To Step 4. 4. Disconnect the shifter rod (14, 16) from the shift lever as follows: a. On 944s, remove the &quot;C&quot; clip (16) from the groove on the shift lever pin. Be careful not to drop the clip. Then, slide the shifter rod off of the pin. Remove the washer (15) from the pin and set aside. b. On 968s, remove the spring clip (17) from the groove on the shift lever pin. Remove the washer (18) and bushing (19) from the shifter rod. You may have to slide the shifter rod off of the shift lever pin to remove the bushing. Remove the other bushing from the shifter rod and the remaining washers from shift lever pin. Page 5 of 9 5. Inspect the shift lever pin for wear. If it is excessively worn, the pin will be tapered instead of the same diameter along it's entire length. If the pin shows excessive wear replace it. On 968 shift levers, it is more likely that the shift lever bushings (2) will be worn instead of the pin. Check the bushings by sliding them onto the shift lever pin and looking for excessive play. If the bushings show excessive wear replace them. 6. Next remove the shift lever from the vehicle by removing the two bolts (13, 15) that hold the bearing bracket (9,11). Page 6 of 9 7. Lift the lever out of the sound absorber and inspect the plastic bearing. If it is cracked, broken, or the shifter comes out of the bearing easily, the bearing should be replaced. Installation 1. If the plastic bearing is to be replaced, apply a small amount of Moly grease to the inside of the bearing and slide the new bearing into the bearing bracket. 2. Push the shift lever ball into the bearing. It will be difficult to push into the bearing. That's normal. Use firm, steady pressure but, don't be overly aggressive as you can break the bearing. 3. Install the shift lever into the sound absorber using the two retaining bolts (M8 x 12). 4. Attach the shifter rod to the shift lever pin using the &quot;C&quot; clip (944s) or spring clip (968s). 5. Check the shift lever alignment using the procedure in the following section. 6. On 944s, install the rubber boot onto the shift lever and work the bottom of the boot onto the lip of the sound absorber opening. 7. On 968s, install the bellows (6) onto the shift lever and attach it to the sound absorber using the four M6 x 16 screws. 8. Install the shift lever knob and boot onto the shift lever using the spring clip. Attach the bottom of the boot to the console. Adjusting the Shift Lever There are two adjustments for the shift lever. One is for the inclination toward the front or rear of the car. The other is for the side-to-side inclination. In the factory shop manuals, this is referred to as lateral inclination or transverse inclination. Unfortunately, in the 968 Manuals, it refers to the side-to-side inclination as transverse inclination, and in the 944 Manual, it refers to it as lateral inclination. So, to avoid confusion, we simply won't use those terms. 1. With the shift lever set to neutral, the shift lever should be inclined toward the rear of the car at an 85° angle. Page 7 of 9 2. If the shift lever is not at the proper angle, loosen (but don't remove) the two bolts for the shifter bearing bracket and slide bracket forward or backward as necessary to obtain the correct angle on the shift lever. Then tighten the two bolts. 3. Also, with the shift lever in neutral, the shift lever should be no side-to-side inclination. In other words, it should not be leaning to the left or right. If so, the side-to-side inclination must be adjusted at the transaxle. 4. To adjust the side-to-side inclination on a 944, perform the following: a. Loosen the lock nut on the intermediate shaft linkage (see picture below). b. Move the intermediate shift lever to the left or right to change the inclination of the shift lever on the console. Moving the intermediate shift lever to the driver's side of the car will incline the shift lever on the console more toward the driver's side. Moving the intermediate shift lever to the passenger's side of the car will incline the shift lever on the console more toward the passenger's side. c. When the console shift lever is at the correct side-to-side inclination, tighten the intermediate shaft lock nut. Page 8 of 9 5. To adjust the side-to-side inclination on a 968, perform the following: a. Loosen the locknuts (no. 1) on the intermediate shift lever adjustment turnbuckle and turn the center piece (no. 2) until there is no side-to-side inclination at the console shift lever (no. 3). b. When the shift lever is properly adjusted, tighten the turnbuckle locknuts. Checking the Transaxle Linkage for Wear The intermediate shift lever at the transaxle shift linkage is partially made of hard plastic (white part in the picture below). Over time the plastic can wear out causing the shifting to become sloppy. If you have already checked and/or replaced the shift lever and shift lever bearing or shift lever bushings (968 only) and there still seems to be some sloppiness to the shifting, inspect the intermediate shift lever for excessive play.

If you can not determine from the option code sticker on your car, or you believe the transaxle has been changed, then you'll have to get the code directly off of the transaxle. This is extremely difficult to do on a 944 transaxle since the code is stamped on top flange near the front of the transaxle. To be able to read the code, you'll need an inspection mirror and a flashlight. You may also need a rag to wipe the area clear of debris to be able to read the code. The drawing below is an example showing the location of the codes and how to translate the code.

There's actually no good way (currently) to test the DME computer. Perhaps someone, down the road, will come up with a good method for bench testing the computer. Until then, the only test you can really do is to try the suspect DME computer in another car OR borrow a know good DME computer to test in place of the suspect computer. The good news is that the majority of DME computer problems in 944s are related to bad solder joints which can be repaired. If you are having problems starting the car and suspect a bad DME computer, try tapping on the computer during cranking. If the engine fires while tapping on the box, you have bad solder joints. If it still doesn't start, that doesn't mean the DME computer is good. It may be good. But, it may also mean that the solder joints are very bad or the DME computer has failed for another reason. The remainder of DME problems are primarily related to water intrusion, especially the later 944s where the DME computer is located in the passenger's footwell below the battery tray. Inspecting Remove the DME computer from the vehicle using DME-01. Using the appropriate steps of DME-02, open the DME computer as if you were going to replace the computer chip. The DME computer has two separate circuit boards which are mounted facing each other and are connected by a flexible ribbon cable. In order to inspect the circuit boards, you'll have to separate the circuit boards. This process is explained in DME-02. When you have the two circuit boards separated (still connected to each other by the ribbon cable), inspect all the solder joints with a magnifying glass. If the solders are dull grey in appearance as opposed to shiny silver, they should be resoldered. Most solders now have some type of rosin core flux to promote better solder flow. However, the flux will frequently leave a brownish residue on the solder joint which many manufacturers neglect to clean off. This can make a good solder joint appear bad. So, before you condemn what appears to be a bad solder joint, first clean the joint with a cotton swab and alcohol to remove any flux residue. When you inspect the solder joints on the circuit boards, pay particular attention to those joints at the connectors for the ribbon cable that connects the two circuit boards. Historically, those solder joints are the most susceptable to being broken or otherwise bad. Then you inspect the inside of the DME computer, look for evidence of water intrusion. Typically, this will be a white residue on portions of the circuit boards or as a visible white line (water line) on the inside of the computer casing. After you've inspected the DME computer, repair any questionable solder joints. After you've repaired any questionable solder joints, reassemble the computer, install, and attempt to test drive the vehicle (assuming the DME is now working), to check the operation of the computer.

However, it is very tedious because there are a lot of components that must be removed to get to the turbocharger. This procedure will provide you with the instructions necessary to remove and install the turbocharger. If you are installing a turbocharger other than a factory replacement (K26-6 or K26-8) there are some things which you should know. First, if the new turbocharger has a larger diameter compressor inlet than the factory unit (i.e. K27), the stock rubber inlet plenum boot will have to be modified and some type of adapter will be needed to connect it to the new turbocharger. Second, if the new turbocharger has a larger compressor housing than the factory unit (i.e. K27), the cooling water outlet line (hard pipe), will have to be reshaped (bent), to clear the housing of the new turbocharger. This may also cause the temperature sensor to come in contact with the bottom of the intake manifold in which case a low profile detector will be required. Lastly, you should ensure that the turbocharger you buy is a good match for your current setup. It may require a new set of chips for the DME and KLR to take full advantage of the new turbo's capability. All the things I've mentioned above are things your turbocharger supplier SHOULD tell you. However, when I purchased my K-27 a number of years ago, my supplier didn't even know that the things I mentioned above were problems. Below is a series of questions you should ask your supplier before purchasing any turbocharger. Turbocharger Questions 1. How do I know if this turbocharger is a good match for my current setup? 2. Are there any modifications or fabrication required to install the turbocharger? 3. Do I need a new set of chips to use this turbocharger or to get the best performance from this turbo? If so, where can I get the chips? 4. Is there any additional equipment I need to get the best performance out of the turbocharger?

Place the car on jack stands or ramps. Using AF-01, remove the air filter housing and air flow sensor. Loosen the clamps on either end of the intercooler outlet pipe (going to the throttle body). Disconnect the two hoses on either side of the intercooler discharge pipe and remove the pipe from the car. 5. Remove the rubber inlet plenum boot from the turbocharger inlet. 6. Using FUEL-02, remove the fuel rail and injectors. 7. Using FUEL-09, remove the intake manifold. 8. Remove the belly pan. 9. Using COOL-02, drain the coolant system. 10. Remove the alternator air supply flexible hose. 11. Remove the turbocharger cooling pump as follows: a. Disconnect the turbocharger cooling pump electrical connector (located along the shock tower near the cooling pump. b. Loosen the 10 mm nut at the strut tower which holds the upper cooling pump bracket and a hold down strap for the air conditioning lines. c. On the back side of the master cylinder heat shield that holds the bottom of cooling pump bracket in place. Using a 10 mm wrench loosen the bolt. You'll need to remove the bolt by turning it with your fingers to keep from dropping it. If you have a magnet, have it handy in case you lose your grip on the bolt. Slide the bracket off the top stud. d. Disconnect the coolant hoses from the cooling pump and remove it from the car. 12. (Optional) Remove the master cylinder heat shield. The turbo can be removed and installed without removing the heat shield. However, it is a much simpler job if you take a little extra time to remove the heat shield. 13. Loosen the heat shield between the turbocharger and the engine block. This will allow you enough remove to loosen and remove the banjo bolt (19 mm) for the turbocharger oil supply line. Be careful not to drop the banjo bolt seal rings when removing the banjo bolt. 14. Remove the two bolts (15 mm) attaching the other end of the oil supply 15. Disconnect the supply and return cooling lines from the turbocharger. 16. Disconnect the flange for the turbocharger supply from the exhaust system. 17. Under the car, remove the heat shield for the steering shaft universal joint. 18. Loosen the four bolts that mount the steering rack to the front cross-member. This will allow you to lower the power steering rack slightly to provide access to the lower turbocharger mounting bolt. 19. Remove the bolts from the triangle flange on the turbocharger outlet pipe (above the O2 sensor). Also remove the M8 bolt that attaches the flange to the engine block. 1. 2. 3. 4. Page 3 of 5 20. On the underside of the motor mount bracket, you'll find the two Allen head bolts that hold the turbocharger to the motor mount bracket. Using a stubby 6 mm socket, short 6 mm hex key, or 6 mm ball head hex socket, remove the two Allen head bolts. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you &quot;wake up&quot; the Allen head bolts (BOLT-01)before you attempt to remove them. If you do not, there is a very good chance that you'll strip the heads on the bolts. You may also find it necessary to disconnect the motor mount bolt and jack the engine up on that side to get enough clearance for proper engagement of the hex head tool into the head of the Allen bolt. 21. You should now be able to lift the turbocharger out of the car. Remember a short length of the outlet pipe will remain attached to the turbo when it comes out of the car. Installation 1. Install the turbocharger exhaust side outlet pipe on the turbo. Make sure you replace the flange seal ring. 2. Place a new o-ring in the groove on top of the motor mount (turbo oil outlet seal). 3. Install a new seal ring in the groove on the turbocharger hot side inlet flange. A small amount of bearing grease applied to the ring will hold it in place while installing the turbocharger. 4. Carefully set the turbocharger in place on top of the motor mount. Be careful not to move the turbo around too much while setting it in place. It is possible to move the o-ring out of the groove and subsequently crush or cut the o-ring when tightening the mounting bolts. 5. Install the two turbocharger mounting bolts from the bottom of the motor mount bracket. 6. Install the heat shield for the steering universal joint. 7. Install and tighten the turbocharger inlet flange bolts. 8. Install the turbocharger oil supply line. Be sure to install a new o-ring at the turbocharger flange and new seal rings for the banjo bolt at the balance shaft housing. 9. Install the mounting bolts for the balance shaft housing heat shield. 10. Install and tighten the mounting bolt which attaches the turbocharger down pipe triangle flange to the block. 11. Install the cooling water supply line and turbocharger cooling pump. 12. Install the master cylinder heat shield. 13. Attach the turbocharger cooling pump to the master cylinder heat shield. 14. Install the turbocharger inlet plenum boot. 15. Install the turbo cooling water outlet line and plug in the turbo coolant temperature sensor. Page 4 of 5 16. Install the down pipe triangle flange bolts. 17. Using FUEL-09, install the intake manifold. 18. Using FUEL-02, install the fuel injectors and fuel rail. 19. Using AF-01, install the air flow sensor and air filter housing. 20. Fill and vent the cooling system using COOL-02.

Unfortunately, if you buy a 951 that's already been modified, unless there's a record of the upgrade, you may not know which turbo you actually have. Peter, a Rennlist member, has come up with a way to identify the difference between the K26-6 and the K26-8. He has graciously allowed me to share that information here in the Garage Shop Manual. Turbo Identification The basic difference between the two turbos is that the K26-6 has approximately a 1&quot; square flat spot on the turbine housing which the K26-8 does not (picture below). Page 1 of 3 With the turbocharger in the car, you can shine a flashlight down alongside and just in front of the engine oil dipstick. Page 2 of 3 Then if you look at a 45-degree angle from the front towards the bottom of the dipstick, you should be able to clearly identify if the turbocharger has the 1&quot; flat square. If it has the square, it's a K26-6. No square, it's a K26-8 (see picture of a K26-6 below).

If so, you should first perform a simple test to determine if the source of the problem is with the electronic portion of the boost control system or if the problem is mechanical. Perform the Low Boost Pressure Test which follows. Low Boost Pressure Test 1. Clamp the actuating line to the wastegate using a hose clamp. 2. Test drive the vehicle and determine the available boost pressure. CAUTION! Use extreme caution when driving the car with the actuating line clamped off. The overboost protection system is defeated by clamping the line. If the charging system is intact, you can overboost the engine and cause extensive damage. 3. If the boost pressure achieved is 1.75 bar as indicated on the car's boost gauge, the mechanical portion of the charging system is working properly. This includes the wastegate, turbocharger, air intake system, and turbo bypass valve. If the minimum boost pressure is not achieved, proceed with testing the individual mechanical components. Wastegate Testing 1. Wastegate testing must be done with the exhaust system initially cold. 2. Raise the vehicle on jack stand. 3. Disconnect the wastegate actuating line for the wastegate and connect a pressure pump. 4. Start the engine an allow it to idle. The exhaust line to the wastegate should heat up after a short period of time. However, if the wastegate is closed and not leaking by, the bypass line out of the wastegate will be cold. 5. Using the pressure pump slowly apply pressure to the wastegate while feeling the bypass line. Page 1 of 2 NOTE Never apply more that approximately 14.5 psi (1 bar) pressure to the wastegate diaphragm during testing. The factory shop manual says to apply 0.6 bar (8.7 psi) of pressure to the wastegate to get it to open. However, the pressures listed below are based on actual numbers from two different 944 Turbo owners who independently tested their wastegates and came up with the same results. 6. At a pressure of approximately 4 psi (0.2 bar), the wastegate should start to open as indicated by a temperature increase in the wastegate bypass line. At a pressure of approximately 7 psi (4.8 bar) the wastegate should be fully open. Of course, you won't be able to see the exact position of the wastegate if you are testing it in place. However, you can check actual position of the valve during a bench test. 7. When the pressure is suddenly removed, the wastegate should close as indicated by an audible click.

To prepare for that, I remove the wastegate from the car, removed the diaphragm from the valve body, and traced around the bottom flange of the diaphragm onto a piece of paper to make a template for further shim fabrication. Some months after I got the car back on the road, I realized that my wastegate would only hold about 17.5 psi boost. After talking to several 951 owners who were getting over 20 psi out the factory wastegate, I figured my spring must be a little weak and it was time I shimmed the wastegate. For those who are unfamiliar with what shimming consists of, it is basically installing washers or gaskets between the wastegate diaphragm and wastegate valve body. The increases the pre-load on the wastegate spring and subsequently the maximum boost pressure the wastegate will hold. Fabricating Shims 1. Shims may be fabricated by making a drawing based on the Shim Template (below) and transferring it to a piece of sheet metal. 2. Alternatively, the wastegate can be disassembled and a template made by tracing the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm onto a piece of paper for instruction on disassembling the wastegate refer to the Shim Installation section.

Using EXH-03, Wastegate Removal and Installation, remove the wastegate from the car. 2. Remove the three Allen head bolts that hole the wastegate diaphragm to the wastegate body (6 mm). NOTE Two of the Allen head bolts hold the wastegate mounting bracket to the wastegate. Mark the orientation of the bracket on the wastegate body prior to remove the bolts. 3. Remove the wastegate valve. The valve has an Allen head insert in the bottom (8 mm). 4. Separate the wastegate diaphragm from the valve body and insert two shims between the valve body and the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm. Insert the Allen head retaining bolts. If the wastegate was removed with the mounting bracket left in the car only install the retaining bolt which threads into the nut which is tack welded onto the diaphragm flange. Before torquing the bolt (20 Nm (14 ft-lbs)), ensure the remaining two bolt holes in the shims are lined up with the holes in the wastegate body and diaphragm. 5.

There are a number of different ways to approach getting the wastegate out but, none are simple. So, what I'll try to do here is explain just how the wastegate is mounted and how I approached getting it out. I'm certainly not claiming that my way is the best so, study the mounting arrangement and decide for yourself which way you think is easiest. Wastegate Mounting Arrangement The wastegate diaphragm is attached to the wastegate valve body by three Allen head bolts (6 mm hex). The bolts go up through the valve body and then through the bottom flange of the wastegate diaphragm. One of the bolts threads into a nut that is tack welded to the diaphragm flange. However, the other two bolt go through the diaphragm flange and thread into bolts that are tack welded to the wastegate mounting bracket. The other end of the mounting bracket is bolted to another bracket that is bolted around the torque tube (two bolts - 13 mm head). The wastegate discharge pipe has a flange that is bolted to the valve body with four bolts (13 mm head) and to the bracket on the torque tube by a single bolt (13 mm head). The other end of the discharge pipe is attached to the rest of the exhaust system by a flange just prior to entering the main exhaust pipe (2 bolts - 10 mm). The wastegate inlet pipe has a flange which is mounted on four studs on the valve body on the other end (just off the cross-over pipe) the inlet pipe is attach by a triangle flange (3 bolts - 10 mm). Now let's list all the problems that make this job difficult: 1. On both flanged connections (inlet and outlet pipe), the pipe is inserted into the flange by at least an inch or two. So, even if you unbolt the wastegate from the torque tube mounting bracket, you still have to remove one of the pipes (inlet or outlet) to get the assembly out of the car. 2. Removing the inlet pipe with the assembly in the car appears to be impossible unless you remove the studs at the inlet flange. Because of the tight working conditions, I didn't consider this an option. 3. Removing the discharge pipe seems much easier at first glance until you realize that the heads on the mounting bolts are too close to the flange to get a STANDARD socket on them (hold that thought). 4. Again, with the discharge pipe inserted into the flange several inches, moving the discharge pipe around enough once it is unbolted is difficult. 5. The wastegate mounting bolts (at the torque tube) are extremely difficult to get to.

Place the car on ramps or jack stands. 2. Remove the 8 mm nut on the back of the starter heat shield. Loosen (don't have to remove) the two bolts on the side of the clutch housing that hold the starter heat shield. Slide the heat shield off the starter and put it aside. 3. Using the flat tip screwdriver, loosen the wastegate diaphragm hose clamp and disconnect the hose from the diaphragm. 4. Next, I chose to remove the wastegate discharge pipe. This requires that you modify a 13 mm socket to fit between the head of flange bolts and the recesses in the flange. I used a bench grinder to grind down the sides of the open end of the socket until I could get it onto the bolts. Once you get the proper fit, remove the four discharge flange bolts. You'll need the universal joint and socket extension to get to a couple of the bolts. 5. Using the 13 mm socket and ratchet, also remove the bolt (1) that attaches the discharge flange to the torque tube mounting bracket. 6. Next, remove the two flange bolts at the other end of the discharge pipe. 7. Using the pry bar, slide the discharge pipe in toward the torque tube and downward toward the starter. Once the flange on the discharge pipe clears the wastegate valve body, you should be able to remove the discharge pipe. 8. Disconnect the triangle shaped flange bolt on the inlet pipe (3 bolts - 10 mm). 9. Locate the two wastegate diaphragm bolts that hold the wastegate mounting bracket. Using a 6 mm hex key or long 6 mm hex head socket remove the two bolts. 10. This should allow you to slide the wastegate off the mounting bracket and out of the car with the inlet pipe still attached. Page 2 of 3 Installing the Wastegate 1. With the inlet pipe attached to the wastegate, slide the end of the inlet pipe into the cross-over pipe flange and attach the wastegate to the mounting bracket with the two Allen head bolts. Torque the bolts to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs) using the 6 mm hex key or long 6 mm hex head socket. Torque the inlet pipe to cross-over pipe flange bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) using a 10 mm socket and wrench or two 10 mm wrenches. 2. Install the wastegate discharge pipe. Torque the flange bolts (4) using the modified 13 mm socket and discharge pipe flange to torque tube bracket bolt (1) to 20 Nm (14 ft-lbs). Torque the discharge pipe to main exhaust pipe flange bolts to 8 Nm (6 ft-lbs) using a 10 mm socket and wrench or two 10 mm wrenches. 3. Connect the wastegate diaphragm hose and tighten hose clamp.

The new style coolant pump has a guard rail for the timing belt an a larger idler roller (46.2 mm vs. 32.0 mm). The new style was installed on all cars produced after July 1986. I recommend installing the new style pump when replacing the water pump. For cars which previously did not have the new style pump installed, this requires modifying the rear timing cover and purchasing a belt guard and larger idler roller. Some of the new style pumps will come with the belt guard already installed so ask your parts supplier when ordering. The groove for the thermostat snap ring has also been moved. Previously, it was 4.5 mm from the sealing surface and is now at 7 mm. This requires the use of a new thermostat and spacer. On Turbocharged cars, there is a nozzle on the water pump which supplies cooling water to the turbocharger bearing housing. On Normally Aspirated cars the nozzle is a block-off plate. The block-off plate / nozzle is sealed to the water pump by an o-ring which should be replaced when the new pump is installed. On some pumps, the block-off plate / nozzle is mounted using a 6 mm stud and nut and a 6 mm x 20 mm bolt. However, most of the new pumps come with two bolt holes. This requires transferring the 6 mm stud from the old pump to the new one or purchasing another 6 mm x 20 mm bolt.

Alternate tapping on one side of the bearing and then the other along the two channels inside the hub. If you do not have access to a brass punch, be extremely careful of the angle you hold the punch to keep from damaging the inner surface of the hub. 11. Once both bearing races are removed, clean the inner surfaces of the hub thoroughly. 1. 2. 3. 4. Page 2 of 3 12. Install the new bearing races into the hub as follows: a. Place the new bearing races in a freezer for a minimum of an hour, preferably overnight. b. Heat the hub assemblies in an oven at 250°F for at least 30 minutes. The longer you leave the hubs in the oven the easier the races will go into the hub. c. Using a pair of gloves, remove the hub(s) from the oven and place on a flat working surface which can not be damaged by the hub. d. Remove the races from the freezer and insert them into the hub. The bearing should drop right into the hub with little or no effort. 13. Pack the new bearings with a good quality moly bearing grease. A bearing packer is the preferred method of packing the bearing but, they can be packed almost as well by placing the bearing in the palm of your hand and pushing grease into the bearing rollers using your fingers. 14.

Trailing arm Procedure NOTE The hardest part of this job may be getting the rear wheel axle nut loose. The reason being is that the axle nut is torqued to 350 ft-lbs. That means if you're using an 18&quot; breaker bar to remove the nut, you have to apply 233 lbs. of weight to the end of the bar. If you're using a 24&quot; breaker bar, you have to apply 175 lbs. of weight to the end of the bar. The problem is that over time, the threads of the axle/nut get a little rust built up on them and then it takes significantly more force than the 350 ft-lb. tightening torque to break the nut free. Sometimes this can double the amount of torque required. With that in mind, if we assume that the amount of torque required to remove the axle nut has doubled to 700 ft-lbs., it may require a breaker bar as long as 4 feet (48&quot;) to get the required weight applied to the end of the breaker bar down to where and average sized individual (175 lbs.) can apply enough force to break the nut free. I had an experience one time on my own car where I was trying the break the axle nut free where even with a 4 foot breaker bar and myself and a friend standing on the bar, we were unable to break the nut free. Finally, the only way I was able to free the axle nut was to drive the car to a shop that does tires for very large trucks. They loosened both axle nuts using a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench and then retighten them with a 1/2&quot; Drive Impact Wrench. Then, I drove the car back to my shop where I completed the job. So, if the following procedure for loosening the axle nut doesn't work, you may have to pursue a similar method to remove the nuts. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Set the emergency brake to assist in removal of the axle nut. Loosen the rear wheel lug nuts on one wheel several turns. Raise that side of the vehicle using a floor jack. Remove the lug nuts and the rear wheel. Remove the cotter pin for the axle. Page 2 of 4 6. Loosen and remove the axle nut as follows: a. First try loosening the axle nut using an appropriate size socket (32mm or 36mm depending on the vehicle) and long breaker bar. If you're lucky the nut will come of easily and you can proceed to Step 7. If this doesn't work, continue with the next step. b. Place the appropriate size socket on the axle nut. I recommend using an impact socket as a standard socket can easily be destroyed if significant torque is required to break the nut free. c. Attach a breaker bar at least 24&quot; long to the socket in a position parallel to the ground and rest the handle end of the bar on a jack stand (or something similar). Realize that to loosen the nut the breaker bar has to be pointed in the correct direction. For the left wheel, the breaker bar must be pointed toward the rear of the car. For the right side wheel the breaker bar must be pointed toward the front of the car. NOTE Make sure that the breaker bar and jack stand are positioned so that they can not damage any of the suspension components or body work when you lower the car. d. With the socket and breaker bar in position, slowly lower the floor jack until the weight of the car breaks the axle nuts free. e. If this does not work, borrow a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench or take the car to a shop with a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench to get the nut loosened. 7. Most early 944s are equipped with spacers on the rear wheels which must be removed. 8. Remove the rear brake caliper. 9. Release the emergency brake. 10. Using a Phillips head screwdriver remove the brake rotor retaining screws. 11. Remove the rotor. It may be difficult to remove. However, the rotor has two threaded M8 holes for bolts to be threaded into for jacking the rotor off of the hub. Remove the parking brake pads, spreader, and brake dust guard (4-19mm hex head bolts). 12. Remove the rear hub. 13. Using the 8mm cheesehead tool, disconnect the CV joint from the trailing arm and hang the axle out of the way. 14. Remove the stub axle using a gear puller or by driving it out with a block of wood and hammer. The inner spacer ring should come off with the stub axle. However, it will sometimes stick to the inner bearing seal. Remove the inner spacer ring and inspect it for scoring and replace if necessary. 15. Remove the inner and outer bearing seals using a seal puller. 16. Remove the snap ring next to the inner wheel bearing. Page 3 of 4 17. Using a soft drift and hammer from the outside of the trailing arm, gently tap on either side of the inner wheel bearing to drive it evenly out of the trailing arm. 18. Working from the inside of the trailing arm, tap on the outer wheel bearing using the drift and hammer to drive it evenly out of the trailing arm. 19. Remove the bearing spacer tube from the trailing arm and clean out all the old grease. 20. Pack both new bearings with grease. 21. Install the new inner bearing using a socket as a driver or a soft face hammer. Make sure that the bearing goes into the trailing arm evenly to prevent binding. Also, make sure that the chamfered edge of the bearing is facing out (from the center of the trailing arm). 22. Install the snap ring next to the inner bearing. 23. From the outside of the trailing arm, pack fresh bearing grease into the trailing arm. Do not pack completely full. Allow room for installation of the bearing spacer and for expansion of the grease as it heats up. 24. From the outside of the trailing arm, install the bearing spacer tube. 25. Using a socket and hammer tap the outer bearing into the trailing arm. Make sure the chamfered edge of the bearing faces out. 26. Install the inner and outer bearing seals. Install the brake guard, parking brake pads, and spreader. 27. Install the stub axle. Make sure the inner spacer ring is installed on the stub axle before you insert the stub axle into the trailing arm. 28. Install the hub and axle nut. Torque the axle nut to 350 ft-lbs and install the cotter pin. 29. Install the brake rotor and secure using the Phillips head screws. 30. Using BRAKE-05, adjust the parking brakes. 31. Install the brake caliper and pads. Make sure to pump up the brakes prior to driving. 32. Install the rear wheel spacer and rear wheels. 33. Lower the vehicle from the floor jack. 34.

First, the aluminum trailing arm uses a single sealed bearing as opposed to a double roller bearing arrangement. The single sealed bearing is also a bit more difficult to remove from the trailing arm than the bearings in the steel arm. The Porsche factory manual describes removing the wheel bearing after the trailing arm has been removed from the car. The factory shop manual has you heat the trailing arm to 120 - 150 °C (approximately 250 - 300 °F). Then you press the bearing out from the back side of the trailing arm using special tool VW 432. Now, I'm sure this method works quite well. However, who wants to remove the trailing arm from the car just to replace the wheel bearing? Not me. So, I elected to use a slide hammer bearing puller to remove the bearing from the trailing arm. And, I didn't heat the trailing arm before removing the bearing. The bearing was a bit stubborn to remove. But, I'm sure it would have been much easier if I had heated the trailing arm first. Consequently, this procedure will differ somewhat from the factory shop manual procedure.

So, if the following procedure for loosening the axle nut doesn't work, you may have to pursue a similar method to remove the nuts. Page 1 of 4 1. Self-Locking Nut 2.

Set the emergency brake to assist in removal of the axle nut. Loosen the rear wheel lug nuts on one wheel several turns. Raise that side of the vehicle using a floor jack. Remove the lug nuts and the rear wheel. Remove the cotter pin for the axle. Loosen and remove the axle nut as follows: a. First try loosening the axle nut using an appropriate size socket (32mm or 36mm depending on the vehicle) and long breaker bar. If you're lucky the nut will come of easily and you can proceed to Step 7. If this doesn't work, continue with the next step. b. Place the appropriate size socket on the axle nut. This may be a 32mm or 36mm socket depending on the vehicle. I recommend using an impact socket as a standard socket can easily be destroyed if significant torque is required to break the nut free. c. Attach a breaker bar at least 24&quot; long to the socket in a position parallel to the ground and rest the handle end of the bar on a jack stand (or something similar). Realize that to loosen the nut the breaker bar has to be pointed in the correct direction. For the left wheel, the breaker bar must be pointed toward the rear of the car. For the right side wheel the breaker bar must be pointed toward the front of the car. NOTE Make sure that the breaker bar and jack stand are positioned so that they can not damage any of the suspension components or body work when you lower the car. d. With the socket and breaker bar in position, slowly lower the floor jack until the weight of the car breaks the axle nuts free. e. If this does not work, borrow a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench or take the car to a shop with a 3/4&quot; Drive Impact Wrench to get the nut loosened. 7. Remove the rear brake pads and calipers. 8. Release the emergency brake. 9. Using a Phillips head screwdriver remove the brake rotor retaining screws. Page 3 of 4 10. Remove the rotor. They may be difficult to remove. However, the rotors have two threaded M8 holes for bolts to be threaded into for jacking the rotor off of the hub. 11. Using the 8mm cheesehead tool, disconnect the CV joint from the transaxle, pull the axle out of the trailing arm, and set it aside. 12. Using a soft drift and hammer from the inside of the trailing arm, drive the rear hub out of the trailing arm. 13. Remove the parking brake shoes, spreader arm, and brake dust guard. 14. Remove the snap ring (circlip) next to the wheel bearing. 15. Heat the area of the trailing arm around the wheel bearing using a torch. Using a slide hammer puller from the outside of the trailing arm, pull the wheel bearing out of the trailing arm. 16. Place a light coating of grease on the inside of the trailing arm bearing surface. This will ease installation of the new bearing. 17. Using a hammer and a socket that is approximately the same size as the new bearing, tap the new bearing into the trailing arm. Make sure that the bearing goes into the trailing arm evenly to prevent binding. 18. Install the snap ring (circlip) next to the bearing. 19.

This troubleshooting procedure is intended to help you determine the cause of problems with the operation of your windows.

So, if the problem is only one one side, the fuse is good. Check Fuse: · · Early 944s (Pre-1985.5) - Fuse 8 (16A), Additional Fuse Panel Late 944s (1985.5 and Newer) Fuse 4 (30A), Central Electric Panel Bad relay If the power window relay is bad, neither window will move. So, if the problem is only one one side, the relay is good. If you suspect that the power window relay is bad, you can remove the relay and jumper terminals 30 and 87 to power the window motors. When you install the jumper, you don't need to turn on the ignition switch to test/operate the power windows. On early 944s, the power window relay is located on the lower left side of the center console near the DME computer. On late model 944s, it's located on the Central Electric Panel (G7). Bad Window Switch If your window problem is only on one / Bad Wiring side, the cause is most likely a bad switch, bad wiring, or a bad window motor. The most common problem of these is the power window switch. So, we will first troubleshoot the switch and in the process check the wiring up to the switch. The passenger window switches (one on each door), are wired in series with the driver's side switch supplying power to the passenger's side switch. So, if you have a problem with the passenger's window it could be either side. The easiest way to test this is to take a known good switch (for Page 2 of 6 Power Window Troubleshooter Symptom Possible Cause Checks example if the driver's window is working fine) and plug it into each of the switch locations for the passenger's window to see if you can get it to start working. Window Switch Test Windows Move Slowly Window Mechanism Lubricate Tracks on Window Mechanism.

Window Motor Check for proper voltage at power window motor plug when window switch is depressed. For instructions on removing the door panels to access the power window motor go to: Door Panels - Removal and Installation. Window Switch Test 1. Remove the window switch to be tested from the door panel. There are four tabs on the window switches (two on top, two on bottom) which must be released to remove the switch. Use extreme caution when trying to release these tabs as they can be easily broken. I usually slide a small flat tip screwdriver under two of the tabs at the same time to release them (see picture below). Page 3 of 6 2. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. 3. Using a voltmeter, on the switch plug, check for approximately 12 VDC from terminal 4 (RD/GN) to ground and terminal 5 (RD/BL) to ground. Proper voltage verifies the power supply and wiring up to the window switch is good. 4. Using an ohmmeter check the window switch as follows: a. When the window switch is depressed in the open direction (see diagram above), you should read a low resistance (less than 1 ohm) from terminals 1 to 4 and terminals 2 to 3. b. When the window switch is depressed in the close direction, you should real a low resistance from terminals 1 to 3 and terminals 2 to 5. 5. If the measurements taken above are not within specification, the window switch is bad. In this case, you have two options. You can replace the switch or you can disassemble the switch and clean the contacts. If you wish to try and clean the window switches, refer to the Window Switch Repair section below. Page 4 of 6 Window Switch Repair Introduction The majority of problems with window switches are the result of dirty contacts. Most of the time, the window switches can be disassembled, the contacts cleaned, and the switches reassembled and they'll function just like new switches. Sometimes however, the switches are worn to the point that the switches will not operate smoothly and they may have to be replaced. Procedure 1. The window switch terminal block on the back of the switch is held in place by four tabs (two on each side) which fit into detents in the switch body. Remove the terminal block by inserting a small flat tip screwdriver into the side of the terminal block on the back of the switch. Make sure you have the back of the switch facing up or the switch internals will fall out when you remove the terminal block. 2. When the terminal block is off, remove the switch internals and inspect the switch contacts. If you measured the switch contact resistances in the switch testing section and the resistances were high, you'll likely find dirty switch contacts (see picture below). Page 5 of 6 3. Clean the switch contacts and reassemble the switch. See the picture below for a comparison of the contacts before and after cleaning. 4. After reassembly, check switch for smooth operation and test in accordance with the Window Switch Test section. NOTE The switch shown in the previous pictures was a non-operating switch which was repaired by simply cleaning the switch contacts.

Fuel Pump Not Starting During Engine Cranking NOTE Labelling on Early 944 (Pre-1985.5) terminal boards may be inconsistent, non-existent, or difficult to read. It may therefore be necessary to determine the terminals to be used for testing by looking at the labels by the stabs on the bottom of the relay. Checks Fuel Pump Fuse Comments Pre-1985.5 944s - Fuse #2 on Auxiliary Fuse Panel 1985.5 and Newer 944s and 968s - Fuse #34 on Central Electric Panel Remove Fuel Pump / DME relay and install jumper to bypass the Fuel Pump / DME relay and DME computer and directly power the fuel pump. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 30 to Terminal 87b If the fuel pump starts, it indicates that the fuel pump, power supply to the fuel pump, and wiring from the relay panel to the fuel pump are good. Therefore, the problem lies in the fuel pump / DME relay, the DME computer, or loss of the signals to the DME computer which cause the fuel pump to start or remaining running after it starts. If that is the case, continue troubleshooting with the next check. If the fuel pump does not start, use an external 12 VDC power source to apply power directly to the fuel pump. If the fuel pump starts, check the wiring from the relay panel to the fuel pump and perform the Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Supply Voltage check. If the fuel pump does not start with power supplied directly at the pump, the fuel pump is bad and should be replaced. Bypass Power to Fuel Pump Page 1 of 8 Fuel Pump Not Starting During Engine Cranking Checks Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Supply Voltage Comments Remove the Fuel Pump / DME Relay and check for supply voltage (approximately 12 VDC) from the battery. Insert a male spade connector into the relay board terminal to make checking the voltage easier. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 30 If no voltage is present, the battery is dead or the wire from the battery to the relay panel is broken / disconnected. Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Primary Coil Voltage Remove the fuel pump / DME relay, turn the ignition switch to the &quot;run&quot; position, and check for approximately 12 VDC at the relay primary coil terminal. All 944s and 968s - Terminal 86 If no voltage is present, the ignition switch is bad, there is a problem with the alarm system (if equipped), or there is a broken wire between the battery and ignition switch, between the ignition switch and alarm module (if equipped), or between the alarm module and fuel pump / DME relay. If equipped with an alarm system, bypass the alarm system using ELECT-23, and repeat the test. If primary coil voltage is present, turn the ignition key off, install the Fuel Pump / DME relay and proceed to the next test. Fuel Pump / DME Relay Primary Coil Activation Disconnect the plug from the DME Computer. Turn the ignition switch to the &quot;ON&quot; position and check for supply voltage (approximately 12 VDC) from the Fuel Pump / DME Relay to the DME computer electrical connector. Page 2 of 8 All 944s and 968s - Terminal 18 to Ground and Terminal 35 to Ground Engine Cranking / Running Signals For the fuel pump to start and remain running, for the ignition coil to develop secondary voltage, and for the injectors to fire, the DME computer must see an engine start signal or an engine running signal (greater than 200 RPM). When it does, it completes the circuit for the Fuel Pump / DME Relay secondary coil and the fuel pump starts. It also provides a ground or current flow path for the ignition coil primary and secondary coils. As a result, the current flow through the primary coil induces a voltage in the secondary coil. The voltage across the secondary coil is what is seen at the distributor. The engine cranking / running signal also goes to the injector drivers (2) which provide a ground or current flow path for the fuel injectors to open. The injectors are batch fired which means that two injectors are fired together. On 944s, injectors 1 and 2 are fired together and injectors 3 and 4 are fired together. The engine start signal is normally generated by a combination of voltage from the ignition switch to the starter solenoid and a signal from the reference sensor. However, if the starter solenoid signal is not present, an engine cranking signal can be generated by the combination of the speed sensor and reference sensor signals. If all of the previous tests have been completed satisfactorily, check for cranking signal inputs as described in the following steps. Page 3 of 8 Engine Cranking / Running Signals Speed Sensor Using an oscilloscope, check the speed sensor output from terminals 8 and 27 on the DME Computer plug. You should get a signal of &gt; 2.5 V. The speed sensor generates an engine speed signal by counting the teeth on the flywheel ring gear. It produces two output pulses for each ring gear tooth. If you don't have an oscilloscope, you can still check the speed sensor by doing a resistance check. Check for 600-1600 ohms between terminals 8 and 27 on the sensor connector. Also, check for infinite resistance between terminals 27 and 23. Page 4 of 8 Engine Cranking / Running Signals Reference Sensor Using an oscilloscope, check the speed sensor output from terminals 25 and 26 on the DME Computer plug. You should get a signal of &gt; 2.0 V. The reference sensor generates an signal relative to engine position at TDC. It produces a single pulse triggered from a bolt cemented in the flywheel. If you don't have an oscilloscope, you can still check the speed sensor by doing a resistance check. Check for 600-1600 ohms between terminals 25 and 26 on the sensor connector. Also, check for infinite resistance between terminals 26 and 78. Starter Solenoid Signal Turn the ignition switch OFF. Disconnect the DME computer plug. Connect a DC voltmeter from terminal 4 on the DME plug to ground. Attempt to crank the vehicle and check for approximately 12 VDC on the voltmeter. If no voltage is present, the ignition switch is bad or the wire from the ignition switch to the DME computer is broken. To check the wire, check the resistance from terminal 50 on the ignition switch electrical plug to terminal 4 on the DME plug. Page 5 of 8 DME Computer Checks DME computer The best way to test for a faulty DME computer is to swap it out with a known good DME computer. Now, most of us don't have the luxury of keeping a spare DME computer sitting around on the shelf. However, if you can borrow a DME computer from a friend for testing that's the best test for the DME. Just realize that you can't test an early 944 (pre-1985.5) using a DME computer from a later car or vice versa. They use different injectors. A later DME will not fire early injectors at all. An early DME MAY fire the injectors in a later car but, the current draw will be excessive and you could potentially damage the DMEs injector drivers. Even if you don't damage the injector drivers, they will likely shut down after a few cycles due to the excessive current draw. Other than that, there's actually very little that can be done to check the operation of the DME computer. However, about the only time a 944 DME computer fails is when it's had water intrusion due to a leaking battery tray or if it has bad solder joints which are easily repairable. If you are having trouble getting the car to start and you suspect the DME computer may be the cause, you can sometimes get the car to start by tapping on the outside of the DME computer case with a rubber mallet. If you suspect the DME computer is causing problems, remove the DME computer from the car and inspect for broken solder joints. When you open the DME computer, you'll find two circuit boards mounted face-to-face inside the box. At one end, the two circuit boards are bridge together by a ribbon cable and at the other they're plugged into the main plug terminal. You'll need to separate the two circuit boards, slide one of the boards out of the connector, and lay the boards open (like a book) to inspect the solder joints. For instructions on how to do this, refer to the appropriate sections of DME-02, DME Control Unit Chip Installation (Including KLR Chip for Turbos). When you inspect the DME for bad solder joints, pay particular attention to the solder joints where the ribbon cable joint the two circuit boards. Those tend to be a common source or problems. Page 6 of 8 Other Fuel Related Problems Symptoms Possible Cause Checks Crank engine while listening for clicking from injectors. Injectors should fire twice for each revolution of the engine. Perform the following to check for fuel injector supply voltage: 1. Disconnect on fuel injector plug. 2. Turn the ignition switch to the ON position. 3. Check for approximately 12 VDC on the injector plug terminals. There will be 12 VDC on one plug terminal and 0 VDC on the other terminal. Injector firing signal not present. Perform checks of Speed Sensor, Reference Sensor, and Starter Solenoid Signal described in the Fuel Pump troubleshooting section. When the fuel pressure runs too high, the fuel injectors draw too much current causing the injector drivers in the DME computer to shut down. Disconnect on fuel injector connector and attempt to crank the engine. If the engine starts, where it would not start with all injector leads connected, the fuel pressure regulator is bad and should be replaced. Disconnecting one fuel injector plug reduces the injector driver current sufficiently to get the injector drivers to fire. Good fuel pressure Injectors Not Firing but no fuel to engine. Good fuel pressure at fuel rail but injectors not firing. No voltage to injectors. Fuel Pressure too high. Page 7 of 8 Other Fuel Related Problems Symptoms Fuel Pressure Low Possible Cause Clogged Fuel Filter. Checks If you don't know or can't verify the last time the fuel filter was changed, it's probably a good idea to replace the filter. Replace check valve. Fuel Pump check valve stuck. Not a normal problem with low fuel pressure. Normally associated with fuel system depressurizing after shutdown as the typically stick open. However, if the car hasn't been run for an extended period of time, the check valve can get stuck closed. New fuel pumps normally come with a new check valve. Fuel Pump bad. Perform fuel pump delivery rate check. (FUEL-04) This assumes that the fuel filter and check valve are good.
