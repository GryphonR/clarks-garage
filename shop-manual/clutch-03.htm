<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

The clutch disc wear should be checked every 15,000 miles as a minimum. If the car is driven hard or is used on the track (Driver's Ed events, Autocross, Time Trials, Full Race) the clutch disc wear should be checked more frequently. I generally recommend every 7500 miles for these cars OR at the end of each race season, whichever comes first.<P>

<OL>
	<LI>Place the vehicle on jack stands.
	<LI>Remove the rubber dust cover from the round inspection port (approximately 1" diameter) on the left hand side of the clutch housing. In all likelihood you'll find this cover missing. I don't think I've seen one on any 944 I've ever worked on.
	<LI>Measure the distance from the front end of the inspection port (edge closest to the front of the car) to the edge of the clutch slave cylinder piston. <P>

In this particular picture the end of the slave cylinder and side of the inspection port are difficult to see. That's because this picture was taken on a turbo with the heat shield for the cross-over pipe in place. If the heat shield is removed it's much easier to see the inspection port from above the cross-over pipe. Also, on normally aspirated cars it's much easier to see since there is no cross-over pipe to obstruct your view.<P>

	<LI>If the measured distance is 34 mm or greater the clutch disc should be replaced. The distance for a new clutch should be approximately 18 mm.
