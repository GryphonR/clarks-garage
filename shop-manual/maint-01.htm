<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

The following maintenance schedule is based primarily on the recommendations from the Porsche Maintenance and General Repairs Manual. However, where noted, I have provided some additional recommendations and in some cases more stringent recommendations than those required by Porsche.

<B>Note:</B> This is initial break-in oil change recommended by Porsche for a new car. As most of our cars aren't new anymore, this generally doesn't apply. However, you should apply this recommendation for a new or freshly rebuilt engine.

 <TD>Change Engine Oil and Filter (Turbo Engines Only)
<OL>
<B>Note:</B>While Porsche recommends a 7500 mile oil change interval for Turbos and a 15000 mile oil change interval for normally   aspirated cars, I feel that shorter oil change intervals are important to the longevity of the engine (bearings, rings, valve train). Personally, I change the oil and filter every 3000 miles (4800 km) and highly recommend that you choose an interval no longer than 5000 miles (8000 km). You should only use a Mahle oil filter with check valve or a Porsche OEM filter. <P>

 <TD>Brake Fluid and Engine Coolant should be replaced every two years regardless of mileage. If the car is tracked, the brake fluid should be changed at least once a year. However, in some PCA regions, to pass a DE Event Tech Inspection, you must provide proof that your brake fluid has been changed within 3 months of the event. <P>

On 944s, the timing belt and balance shaft belt should be changed at 45,000 miles. For 968s, they should be changed at 60,000 miles. For both the 944 and 968, the belt condition and tension should be checked every 15000 miles.  The 15,000 mile inspection interval assumes that the car has bee driven on a regular basis. If your timing belt is two years old and you have not reached the 15000 mile inspection interval, the timing belt tension and condition should be checked then and once per year after that.<P>

For 944s it is unusual for a water pump to last significantly past 100000 miles. For that reason, I recommend replacing the water pump at every other belt change (90000 miles). For 968s, it may be possible to extend the life of the pump to the second belt change at 120000 miles. However, you should monitor for indications of a failing water pump closely after 100000 miles. <P>

For timing belt and balance belt tensioners and rollers, I recommend removing the rollers and spinning by hand at each timing belt replacement. If the roller is noisy, it should be replaced. All rollers should be replaced at every other belt change unless it's an individual roller that was replaced during the previous belt change. For pre-1987 model 944s, the timing belt tension roller stud should be replaced at every other belt change.<P>
