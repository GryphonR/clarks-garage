<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

First, I'd like to apologize for sitting on this procedure for so long. I was searching through some of my files the other day and realized only then that I had it. Second, I'd like to apologize to the individual who provided the procedure and pictures. Again, I've had it so long that I don't remember who provided it. So, I can't give credit where credit is due. Bottom line is, I can't take credit for this but I'd like to thank the person who provided it. <P>

This article will walk you through the removal of your heater core. The
factory manuals will tell you to remove the dashboard to gain access to the
heater core. Actually, the absence of the dashboard is not necessary. It would
make the heater core easier to reach, sure, but it would make the job much
harder overall! I did this job on a 1992 968 so this procedure should apply to
any late (1985.5-1991) 944 or 968.<P>

 <li>These two plastic duct pieces must now be removed.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1027" src="../graphics/968heatercore02.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>The lower piece is secured with one screw. Undo it, and remove the piece.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1028" src="../graphics/968heatercore03.jpg" border=0></p>

<p align=center><img width=514 height=480 id="_x0000_i1029" src="../graphics/968heatercore04.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Cut this zip-tie holding a wire to the upper duct piece.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1030" src="../graphics/968heatercore05.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>There are 3 screws holding the upper duct piece. Remove this screw pictured.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1031" src="../graphics/968heatercore06.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Now remove these 2 screws.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1032" src="../graphics/968heatercore07.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>The yellow arrows show again the 2 upper screws for the upper duct piece. With all 3 screws out, pull and remove the piece.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1033" src="../graphics/968heatercore08.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>The piece in my hand. Note the shape, and note shape of where you just pulled it from, so you know how to reinstall it.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1034" src="../graphics/968heatercore09.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Place a container under the heater core pipe connections to catch spilling coolant. I used <span
     class=SpellE>tuperware</span>. Use a screwdriver to pry off these 2 clips on the heater core pipes. Don't lose these clips!</li>

<p  align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1035" src="../graphics/968heatercore10.jpg" border=0></p>

<p align=center><img width=370 height=298 id="_x0000_i1036" src="../graphics/968heatercore11.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Pull/hold these vacuum elements out of the way, along with anything else obstructing the foam-padded heater core.</li>

<p  align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1037" src="../graphics/968heatercore12.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Start pulling out the core. Yea! The heater core is coming out, and you didn't even have to touch the dash!</li>

<p  align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1038" src="../graphics/968heatercore13.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>You will soon find the core won't simply slip out. It will run into the wire looms circled. It would
     seem the wiring was run AFTER the core was installed, because there just
     isn't enough clearance here. You need to undo the plastic strap here,
     which I have already done in this picture, and remove it completely. Then
     just push and pull on the wires while tugging out the core.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1039" src="../graphics/968heatercore14.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Eventually the core will squeeze by and finally make it all the way out of its housing.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1040" src="../graphics/968heatercore15.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>The dotted circle shows the
     inevitable damage that will occur to your wire loom. As long as no
     insulation was broken, it's fine. The arrow above that shows the painted
     stud where that plastic strap was removed from.</li>

<p align=center><img width=696 height=522 id="_x0000_i1041" src="../graphics/968heatercore16.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>The heater core is now out.</li>

<p align=center><img width=640 height=480 id="_x0000_i1042" src="../graphics/968heatercore17.jpg" border=0></p>

 <li>Installation is the reverse of removal. </li>
