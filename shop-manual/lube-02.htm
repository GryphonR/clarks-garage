Early 944s produced from 1983 to 1986 used a three piece piston and spring oil pressure relief valve. Early 1987 924S used the spring and piston relief valve as well. Early 1987 engines which began production in July 1986 received a new one piece pressure relief valve. <P>

A one piece pressure relief valve was also produced as retrofit for the early three piece relieve valves. The part number for the retrofit relieve valve is 944 107 035 11. <P>

The part number for the early 1987 relief valve was 944 107 035 01. However, the early relief valves were not corrosion treated and were subject to failure. All 1987 engines produced from October 1986 on received a corrosion treatment which alleviated most of the failure problems. The table below lists 1987 engines by number and which relief valve they received. The early 1987 relief valves should be replaced during oil cooler seal repairs or at the first sign of oil pressure related problems. This valve was later replaced by a newer style one piece relief valve (944 107 035 02).<P>

* All vehicles with engine numbers between the numbers listed above should have their oil pressure relief valve replaced during oil cooler seal repairs or if oil pressure problems occur. 
<P>

If you have a vehicle that uses an old style three piece relief valve, I recommend NOT replacing the old style valve unless it fails. In my opinion, the old style valve is just as reliable as the new style valve. The newer style valve is also a bit pricey. When replacing the relief valve it is important to ensure that you get the correct one piece relief valve for your particular vehicle. The two relief valves are of different lengths and are not interchangeable. The table below lists vehicles and part numbers for each relief valve. <P>

* Each relief valve has an O-ring (944 107 935 11) and an aluminum seal ring (N 043 815 3) which should be replaced each time the relief is removed. <P>

One of the things that I don't particularly like about the new style relief valve is that oil cooler housing alignment is critical to prevent binding of the relief valve. To accomplish this an alignment tool should be used when the oil cooler housing is being installed. Cars which have relief valve 944 107 035 02 use special tool 9262/1. Cars which use relief valve 944 107 035 11 use special alignment tool 9215.
