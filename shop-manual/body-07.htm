There has been a great deal of controversy over the years as to what jacking points should be used to jack a 944. The primary jacking point is located at the center of the rocker panels as indicated by the diamond-shaped indent at the base of the rocker. This jacking point will raise both wheels on that side of the car of the ground at the same time. Several years ago, at someone's recommendation, I started using a solid rubber hockey puck between the jack pad and that jacking point which works very well. However, depending on the lowered height of your floor jack and the ride height of your car, you may not be able to slide the jack under the car with a hockey puck on top of the pad. In fact, if your car is low enough, you may have difficulty  getting the floor jack under the rockers at all. If that is the case, you may be forced to roll the wheels on to boards to raise the vehicle enough for a floor jack. This center jacking point is the best place to raise the vehicle when placing it on jack stands. <P>

With regards to other jacking points, there are two round pads behind the front wheel wells that appear to be jacking points. I have used these points for years with great success. However, many 944 owners claim that these are not jacking points and have experienced bending of the floor pan when trying to use these points. You can use the points safely provided the load isn't concentrated too much on that jacking point or the pad on your jack doesn't contact the area around the pad at all. If you have a jack with an oversize pad area it will contact the area around that jacking point. However, if you use a small block of wood or hockey puck between the jacking point and the pad on the jack or jack stand will prevent the pad from contacting the area around the jacking point and will distribute the load more evenly across the pad. You can also place the jack or jack stand on the frame rail or on the front suspension cross member. However, if the cross-member is to be removed for maintenance or repairs the cross-member is not an option. <P>

The rear jacking points are along the bottom edge of the rocker panels just in front of the rear wheel wells. These points work well for most repairs. However, if the engine is to be removed, the car can become easily unbalanced and tilt toward the rear if these points are used. If the engine is to be removed it is better to place the jack stands on somewhere along the rear torsion tube assembly. On most vehicles there are also two round pads behind the rear wheels that may be used. However, unless you have a set of very tall jack stands, they may not provide enough height to work effectively under the vehicle.<P>

There are two other points behind the rear wheels on the frame rail that appear to be jacking points. However, I've never tried to use them and I'm not positive they exist on all 944 models.<P>


To place a 944 on jack stands:<P>

<OL>
 <LI>Using a floor jack on the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels, raise one side of the vehicle to the desired height.
 <LI>Place jack stands under the front and rear jacking points to be used on that side. 
 <LI>Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered. Use extreme caution as this is probably one of the most dangerous operations you will perform while working on your car.
 <LI>Once the car is securely on the jack stands, lower the jack the rest of the way and move to the other side of the vehicle.
 <LI>Again, using the center jacking point raise the vehicle to the desired height. Make sure that as the car is jacked it is balanced on the jack as it leaves the ground.
 <LI>Place the jack stands into position under the jacking points to be used on that side of the vehicle. 
 <LI>Very slowly lower the car into position on the jack stands checking to make sure that the jacks are properly positioned as the car is being lowered.
 <LI>When the car is securely in position on the jack stands, the jack may be lowered the rest of the way.

</OL><P>
To remove a 944 from jack stands:<P>

<OL>
 <LI>Raise the jack into position under the jacking point at the center of the rocker panels.
 <LI>When the weight of the car is removed from the jack stands remove them from under the vehicle.
 <LI>Very slowly, lower that side of the vehicle to the ground. Use extreme caution when lowering the vehicle. If it is lowered too quickly, you may dislodge it from the jack stands on the other side of the vehicle causing damage to the car or injuring yourself.
 <LI>Move the jack to the other side of the vehicle and repeat.
</OL>
