<OL>
<LI>Disconnect the battery negative lead (13mm nut for factory leads)
<LI>Remove/disconnect the DME and/or KLR control unit as follows:
<OL>
<LI type=A>Early Models:<OL>
<LI type=1>The  DME unit on early models is located underneath the dash to the left of the steering column.
<LI type=1>Release the clip on the cable end of  the plug  and swing the connector up and out of the plug.
<LI type=1>Remove the two mounting bolts holding the DME control unit and remove the control unit from under the dash.</OL>
<LI type=A>Late Models:<OL>
<LI type=1>Pull back the carpet at the front of the passenger footwell.
<LI type=1>Remove the four screws which mount the wooden panel in the footwell and remove the panel.
<LI type=1>This will expose the DME control unit. It will be necessary to remove the DME control unit's mounting bracket screws (2 screws and 2 plugs) to enable you to access the wiring harness plug. (On Turbo models, there are 2 control units. The larger of the two is the DME, or fuel and boost, unit and the smaller is  the KLR, or anti-knock, unit).
<LI type=1>Release the clip on the cable end of  the plug  and swing the connector up and out of the plug. 
<LI type=1>On turbocharged cars there is also a hose connection which feeds manifold pressure to the KLR for boost sensing. It is attached to the unit with a small banjo bolt (7mm). When you remove the bolt be sure not to lose the two banjo bolt seal rings.
