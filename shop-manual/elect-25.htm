<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

The following ignition switch replacement procedure was authored by Dean Smith. I'd like to thank Dean for taking the time to write such a complete, detailed procedure. He also took the time to document the replacement with pictures. It will make your ignition switch replacement a breeze.<P>

	I was having starting problems that were driving me crazy. I 
	re-soldered the DME, replaced the coil, and checked the speed and reference 
	sensors. Everything was ok. Finally I located the problem. With the 
	ignition switch and its associated mounting out of the car, it would start no 
	problem. As soon as I install it in the car it would not work. Closer 
	inspection of the switch revealed that it was cracked .<P>

	These are a couple of photos of the broken switch.<P>

The following is a basic set of instructions and photos from my 1987 924s. 
This car does not have air bags and I have a Dino Wheel so your car may be 
different.<p>

Ok lets get started. First off you will be dealing with allot of 
little screws. Make sure that you have a container to put them in as you 
take things apart. It is also important to lay things out in order as you 
remove then as it is easy to leave something out during the reassembly<p>

<P align="right"><B><I>Dean Smith</I></B></p><P>



<B><U>Tools that you will need:</U></B><P>

<UL>
 <LI>Phillips screwdriver #1 Tip (smallest of the standard sizes)
<LI>Metric Allen wrench set
<LI>Couple of various sized flat screwdrivers
<LI>Small pry-bar
<LI>Hammer
<LI>Brass drft or large deep dish socket
<LI>Small scribe or small coal chizzes to mark location of the wheel relative 
to the steering column
<LI>You may need a Steering wheel puller 
<LI>Good Shop Light


</UL>

<B><U>Lets Get Started</U></B><P>

Here is my steering wheel. Note that it is centered and double check that the wheels are strait.

Here is a couple of photos of the left and right sides.</b></p>

<OL>
 <LI>To remove my wheel I have to take the six Allen bolts out in the center of the wheel. <font color="#FF0000">THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING 
WHEEL</font>. Refer to <A href="body-25.htm">BODY-25</A>, Steering Wheel Removal and Installation for more information on steering wheel removal.
<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-10.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Once the wheel is free you have to disconnect the wires for the horn. <font color="#FF0000">THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL</font><p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-11.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Next remove the rubber boot from around the adaptor/crush zone.<font color="#FF0000">THIS 
IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL</font><p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-12.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-13.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>On my set up there is a marking for where the &quot;TOP&quot; should be. If 
you have not done it already make sure your wheel is centered. <font color="#FF0000">THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL</font><p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-14.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Next remove the center nut. This may requite some muscle Mine comes off rather easy. I put a large screwdriver through the adaptor bracket and 
hold it while I take the nut off with a socket. Take the nut and washer of but DON'T TAKE THE ADAPTOR / WHEEL OFF YET. <font color="#FF0000">THIS IS NOT 
THE SAME AS A STOCK STEERING WHEEL</font><p>

 <LI>Once the nut and washer are off you have to scribe the shaft and the adaptor. On the stock wheel you will be scribing the wheel. The mark on the adaptor is hard to see but it is there. Note the mark on the steering column.
<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-15.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Once you mark or index the parts you can continue taking it apart. Slide the steering wheel or steering wheel adapter off of the steering column.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-16.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Now you are looking at the top of the switches / stalks. Remove the three flat head screws on top of the stalk.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-17.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Now that you have removed the screws the stalks will be loose. You now have to remove the plastic housing around the stalks. It splits 
longitudinally and is held in place with two screws that are from below. The reason I did not remove this first is it is easier with the wheel removed and 
with the stalks loose it is easier to remove the plastic pieces. Here are a couple of photos showing the screw locations looking up from below.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-18.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-19.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

Here is a photo of the two screws. Note that they are two different sizes.<P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-20.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Now it is time to CAREFULLY slide the stalks off the column. There are a bunch of wires connected to the switches. In my car I don't have to 
remove them. I carefully pull them forward from underneath as I gently pull on the switches out. You will also note that the two stalks / switches can 
separate from each other. If this happens it is ok. Just carefully continue to pull/guide the wires out until the switch clearers the steering 
column. Repeat the process with the second one. If the two switches came apart I then CAREFULLY put the two switches back together once 
they are removed. The following photo shows the top switch removed.<P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-21.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

This photo shows the bottom switch removed. <P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-22.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<p>Both switches removed and reassembled. Note that I still have the wires attached. You could remove the wires but I prefer to do it this way because if 
you forget to hook up a wire that happens to pull back through the dash it will be a real pain to attach it after you put it all back together.
<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-23.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

Another photo of the two switches.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-24.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-26.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>This is what you should now have left. Note the three little holes that are where the three screws went that hold the switches. These can be broken off very easily. DO NOT 
PRY/LEAN or hang anything from these. If you brake any of these you will have to replace the whole piece. A couple of other things to note ate the 
bearings around the column and the Allen head bolt that is visible on the left side of the column.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-28.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Here is another photo from the side. The next thing to remove is the plastic spacer collar that is around the steering column. To get this off I pry 
gently but firmly in the slots around the bottom. Once it moves a little I switch to a small pry bar that is thicker and wider than my largest screwdriver 
and carefully work it off. DO NOT PRY ON ANY OF THE THREE SMALL SCREW HOLE'S AS THEY WILL BRAKE OFF.<P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-29.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

The piece that my screwdriver is touching is the spacer collar.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-30.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

The piece removed.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-31.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Now you have to remove the Allen head bolt on the left side of the column.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-32.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

You get at this through a whole in the bottom of the dash.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-33.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>With this bolt removed the asemble with the ignition switch will slide out. Note that there are a bunch of wires attached to the back of the 
switch.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-34.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-35.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>Unplug the wires from the back of the ignition switch. Now flip the piece over and look at the back where the wires were plugged 
in and you will see a small Phillips screw. Remove this and the switch will slide out.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-36.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

Here is the unit with the screw removed.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-37.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>You can then slide the switch out.<P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-38.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>On my new switch I put some grease on the end of the switch where the tang from the lock engages as this will see alot of wear.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-39.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

 <LI>You are now ready start the reassembly. I will not cover the whole thing just a couple of highlights.<p>

When I put the bracket back I packed the bearings with fresh grease.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-40.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

The plastic ring/spacer will get some burs on it. I lightly sanded / filed them off before I reinstalled it. I also put a light coating of grease 
inside to aid in it slipping back on. When reinstalling this do not use a screwdriver and a hammer to tap it in place. It will damage the plastic or 
even split it. I use a large deep socket and tap on it alternating forum side to side.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-41.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

When I install the plastic trim pieces I again do this with the switches in place but not screwed in place. this will give you a little play when 
you put the trim pieces back on. In the following photo you will se how I place the top trim piece. I then push it down and back in place. It 
should just snap in place.<p>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-42.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

<CENTER><IMG src="../graphics/ignition-switch-43.jpg" width=640 height=480 border=0  alt=""></CENTER><P>

Well that about covers it. I hope this helps.<p>
