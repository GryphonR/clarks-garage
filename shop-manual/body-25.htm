<OL>
	<LI>Disconnect the battery negative lead.
	<LI>Remove the steering wheel as follows:

<OL>
 <LI type=a>For car without air bags:
<OL>
	<LI>Remove the steering wheel horn pad by pulling firmly on the pad. It'll be tough but, don't worry about breaking it. If you have an aftermarket wheel (i.e. Momo) with a center horn button, gently pry around the outside of the button with a small flat tip screwdriver or probe to dislodge the button from the wheel.
	<LI>Disconnect the wire from the back of the horn button.
	<LI>Using a 15/16" (or 24 mm) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and the washer behind the nut.
	<LI>Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft.
	<LI>Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column.<P>

</OL>
 <LI type=a>For cars with air bags:
<OL>
 	<LI>The air bag can be removed after the battery has been disconnected for at least 30 minutes.
	<LI>On the back side of the steering wheel there are two Torx head screws which are recessed into the back of the column. Using a T30 Torx socket and ratchet, remove the screws. 
	<LI>Slide the air bag assembly off of the front of the steering column and disconnect the plug on the back of the air bag. Set the air bag aside where it can not get damaged (face up).
	<LI>Using a 15/16" (or 24 mm) socket and ratchet, remove the steering wheel retaining nut and the washer behind the nut.
	<LI>Using a paint pen, finger nail polish, or other appropriate marker, mark the orientation of the steering wheel to the splines on the end of the steering column shaft.
	<LI>Pull the steering wheel straight off the end of the steering column.<P>

<B><U>Installation</U></B><P>
<OL>
	<LI>Slide the steering wheel on to the steering column paying attention to the alignment marks made during removal.
	<LI>Install the wheel retaining nut and torque to 45 Nm (33 ft-lbs).
	<LI>For non-airbag cars attach the horn button wire to the horn button pad and press the pad into place on the steering wheel.
                <LI>For airbag equipped cars, attach the wire to the back of the airbag, slide it into the steering wheel, and attach by installing the two Torx head screws (T30).
               <LI>Standing outside the car reach into the car and turn the ignition on. The reason for being outside the car is that this is one of the times I've seen airbags inadvertently deploy. Start the car and see if the airbag warning light is illuminated. If it is, reset the warning light using <A href="elect-12.htm">ELECT-12</A>.
