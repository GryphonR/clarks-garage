If you find this web site to be a useful tool and would like to help maintain and strengthen it, there are several ways you can go about doing that. 
<P>

First and foremost, you can support this web site by continually providing your feedback to improve the quality of the procedures and technical articles on the site. This also includes submitting ideas for new procedures or submitting procedures for inclusion on the site. It doesn't matter if they're hand written notes on a napkin. Send them to me. I'll take care of the rest. <P>

Another area where I could really use some help is with pictures. If you end up using a procedure that has no pictures, is currently using pictures from the factory shop manual, or you'd simply like to see more pictures, take the time to snap a few pictures here and there and send them to me. Eventually, I'd like to print a hard copy version of the web site but, I 
need a lot more pictures to do that. I'm even considering the purchase of a couple of 944s (one early model, one late model) that are in need of restoration just to have a resource for taking pictures during the restoration process. <P>

Finally, I have, over the years, had a number of requests wanting to know if I accept donations. And, I've had many more requests lately. Early on, I was running the site on a freebie web service so, there was really no need to accept donations. As the web site has progressed, I've moved it to a web host were I have almost unlimited storage and bandwith and, more importantly, no pop-up ads. I've also purchased a few software packages to help with the development and maintenace of the site. So, if you would like to make a donation to the site, I will gladly accept them. But, they are strictly voluntary. You may make a donation anonymously or if you would like to be credited for your support of the site, let me know. If you would like to be credited include your name, location (general, no specific address for privacy considerations), and what model 924, 944, or 968 you drive. <P>

<B>There are several ways you can make a monetary donation to support the site:<P>
