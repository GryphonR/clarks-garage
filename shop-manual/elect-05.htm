<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

The rear hatch defroster grid is basically a big resistor. So, when the defroster is operating properly, with a voltmeter you will be able to measure +12 VDC on one side of the grid and 0 VDC (or ground). <P>

<B><U>Procedure</U></B><P>

<OL>
 <LI>Turn on the ignition and the defroster switch. 
 <LI>Using the voltage measuring function on the Multimeter, connect the negative lead to a ground point on the car and use the positive lead to check for voltage on both sides of the grid. You should measure +12 VDC on the left side of the grid and 0 VDC on the right side. 
 <LI>On the right side of the grid, you should be able to measure 0 resistance from the grid to ground using the ohmmeter function of the Multimeter. 
 <LI>If you read 0 VDC on both sides of the grid, there may be a bad connection on the 12 VDC side (left) of the grid. If you read 12 VDC  on both sides, the grid's ground connection (right) may probably bad. 
<LI>If the readings did not check properly, check the electrical connectors on either side of the grid to make sure they are making good contact. 
 <LI>If you did not read +12 VDC on the left side of the grid, another possible cause is a bad fuse or bad defroster relay. On early 944s (pre-1985.5), the defroster is powered via Fuse #4 (25A) on the Auxiliary Fuse Panel (under dash driver's side - LHD). On later 944s, the defroster is powered from Fuse #13 (30A) on the Central Electric Panel (under hood).
 <LI>If it is suspected that the relay may be the cause of the problem, perform the following:
 <OL>
 <LI type=a>Remove the relay from the relay panel.
 <LI type=a>Turn the ignition switch ON. 
 <LI type=a>On the relay panel, jumper defroster relay contacts 30 and 87. Check for proper operation of the defroster.
</OL>
<LI>If the electrical connector tab has become disconnected from the rear window defroster grid, there are several adhesive kits made specifically for reattaching the grid:
<UL>
 <LI>Permatex 21351, Electrically Conductive Rear Window Defogger Tab Adhesive
 <LI>Loctite 21351, Rear Window Defogger Tab Adhesive
</UL>
Make sure that you clean the damaged lug and window glass thoroughly before attempting the repair.
 <LI>If you discover that the defroster grid lines are damaged, there are kits to repair the grid lines:
<UL>
 <LI>Permatex 15067, Quick Grid Rear Window Defogger Repair Kit
 <LI>Loctite 15067, Rear Window Defogger Repair Kit
</UL>
