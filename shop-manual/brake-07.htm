<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

Checking the Brake System is an important part of preventive maintenance for any vehicle. Since 1984, all 944 models and the 968 are equipped with wear indicators. When the brake pads are worn to the point that the wear indicators make contact with the rotor, a light will be illuminated on the dash to indicate that the pads need to be replaced. However, the wear indicators can become damaged and should not be considered 100% reliable for indicating when the brake pads should be replaced. The Brake System should be checked every 15,000 miles as a minimum. However, you should also check the brakes any time you have the wheels removed for other maintenance. <P>

	<LI>Place the vehicle on jack stands.
	<LI>Remove the wheels.
	<LI>Looking from the side of the brake caliper you can see the brake pad and rotor in the opening in the caliper.
	<LI>Measure the distance between the metal backing plate on the brake pad to the surface of the rotor. This is the brake lining thickness. 
	<LI>If the brake lining thickness is 5/64" (2 mm), replace the brake pads. However, due to differences in brake lining rivet thickness Porsche generally recommends replacing pads if the linings are less than 2.5 mm (3/32").
	<LI>If you have difficulty measuring the brake lining thickness, remove the brake pad and measure the thickness of the lining. '
	<LI>Also, inspect the brake calipers, hoses, and fittings for signs of leakage or cracking and repair/replace as necessary.

<OL>
	<LI>Park the vehicle on a steep hill with the transmission in neutral. 
	<LI>If the parking brake will not hold the vehicle stationary with the transmission in neutral, adjust the parking brake using <A href="../shop-manual/brake-05.htm">BRAKE-05</A>.
	<LI>If the parking brakes will still not hold after adjustment, remove the rear rotors and inspect/replace parking brake pads as necessary.
