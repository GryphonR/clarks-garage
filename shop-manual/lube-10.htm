<B><U>Introduction</U></B><P>

The following contains factory instructions for pressure testing the oil cooler element used on normally aspirated 944s. If you have experienced a mixing of oil and water on your car and are replacing the oil cooler seals as a result, it's a good idea to pressure test the oil cooler element at the same time. <P>

If you don't want to bother with setting up the test rig for the oil cooler element, simply take it to a radiator shop and they will be able to pressure test it for you.<P>


<B><U>Tools</U></B>

<UL>
	<LI>Dust Cap (23 mm or 1 inch)
	<LI>Hose Clamp for Dust Cap
	<LI>Water Container to Submerge Oil Cooler
	<LI>Hose large enough to connect to other Oil Cooler Nozzle (1 inch)
	<LI>Air supply
	<LI>Adapter to connect air supply to 1 inch hose
</UL><P>
<B><U>Testing</U></B><P>

<OL>
	<LI>Place a dust cap with clamp on one of the oil cooler nozzles.
	<LI>Connect a 1 inch hose to the other oil cooler nozzle and, using adapters, connect and air supply to the 1 inch hose. 
	<LI>Submerge the oil cooler in a tank of water.
	<LI>Pressurize the oil cooler, using the compressed air supply, to approximately 0.8 bar (12 psi).
	<LI>Look for evidence of air bubbles coming from the oil cooler. If bubbles are present, replace the cooler element.
