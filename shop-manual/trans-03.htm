	<LI>Disconnect the battery negative lead
	<LI>Place the vehicle on jack stands.
	<LI>At the transaxle, push back the rubber boot on the shift linkage. Cut the lock wire on the retaining bolt. Remove the bolt and disconnect the shift linkage from the transaxle.
	<LI>On early vehicles with carpet on the console underneath the shift lever perform the following:
		<OL type=a>
		<LI>Inside the vehicle, pull up on the bottom of the leather shift lever boot to separate it from the rubber inner boot. 
		<LI>Pull up the carpet around the rubber boot.
		<LI>Slide a small flat tip screwdriver under the edge of the trim piece at the base of the rubber boot. Push on the clips with the screwdriver to remove the trim piece. 
		<LI>Pull up on the rubber shift boot to separate it from the shifter opening.
		<LI>Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip which holds the shift knob to the shifter.
		<LI>Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip which holds the shift linkage to the shifter.
		</OL>
	<LI>On later vehicles with plastic trim around the shifter boot perform the following:
		<OL type=a>
		<LI>Using a flat tip screwdriver gently pry around the base of the shifter boot next to the console. Be careful not to damage the boot. This will separate the boot and inner trim ring from the console.
		<LI>Pull up on the rubber inner boot to separate it from the shifter opening.
		<LI>Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip which holds the shift knob to the shifter.
		<LI>Using a probe or small flat tip screwdriver, remove the clip which holds the shift linkage rod to the shift lever.
		</OL>
	<LI>Once the shift linkage rod is disconnected from the shift lever, turn the shift rod down and push toward the front of the vehicle. This will disengage the shift linkage rod from the transaxle.
	<LI>Remove the covers on the bottom of the transaxle bellhousing.
	<LI>Roll the rear wheels until the drive shaft retaining bolts (2) are accessible through the opening in the bottom of the transaxle bellhousing. You'll have to engage the clutch pedal to roll the wheels.
	<LI>Mark the position of the clamping sleeve on the drive shaft so that they may be reassembled in the same orientation.
	<LI>Using an 8 mm Allen head socket remove the clamping sleeve bolts.
	<LI>Slide the clamping sleeve off the drive shaft splines toward the transaxle.
	<LI>Set the parking brake to keep the wheels from moving. Disconnect the CV joints (8 mm cheesehead tool) at the transaxle and hang out of the way with shock cords or bailing wire.
	<LI>Disconnect the backup light wires near the top of the transaxle.
	<LI>On vehicles with electronic speedometers, disconnect the cable for the speedometer sensor on the transaxle.
	<LI>Remove the nuts and bolts (4) that attach the torque tube bellhousing to the transaxle.
	<LI>Support the transaxle with a floor jack.
	<LI>Disconnect the fuel filter from the transaxle support cross-member and remove the two bolts (M10) that attach the transaxle cross-member to the chassis.
	<LI>Move the transaxle toward the rear of the car enough to slide the shift linkage tube out of the way and disconnect the drive shaft clamping sleeve.
	<LI>Lower the transaxle as you move it rearward to clear the spare tire well. 
	<LI>Once the shift linkage tube is removed and the drive shaft is clear of the transaxle, lower the transaxle from the car.

	<LI>Using a floor jack, raise the transaxle into position against the torque tube bellhousing. 
	<LI>Insert the shift linkage rod protective tube into the transaxle case. Ensure retainer is fully engaged into the case.
	<LI>Guide the shift linkage rod back until it engages the transaxle intermediate shaft. Apply loctite to the shift rod retaining bolt. Install bolt and torque to 21 Nm (15 ft-lb). Lock the bolt in position with steel wire.
	<LI>Through the access opening in the bottom of the transaxle case, slide the clamping collar into place over the drive shaft  splines. Torque the Allen head retaining bolt to 80 Nm (58 ft-lb.)
	<LI>Install the transasxle bell housing covers. 
	<LI>Install the transaxle support cross-member bolts (2 - M10). Torque the bolts to 46 Nm (34 ft-lb). Attach the fuel filter to the cross-member.
	<LI>Install the transaxle case to torque tube bell housing nuts and bolts. The M12 fasteners are torqued to 85 Nm (62 ft-lb.) and M10 fasteners to 42 Nm (30 ft-lb).
	<LI>On  vehicles with electronic speedometers, plug in the speedometer sensor cable at the transaxle.
	<LI>Connect the backup light wires near the top of the transaxle.
	<LI>Connect the CV joints to the transaxle. Torque the CV joint bolts to 41 Nm (30 ft-lb).
	<LI>Connect the shift linkage to the shift lever.
	<LI>Reassemble shifter console.
